### Basil Bekdash

Without portfolio but always chasing the data and trying to make sense of chaos and/or complexity.

A paediatric surgeon by background but very happy to join anyone at the interfaces or outside domains, looking for commonalities obvious and otherwise.

Clinical Safety Officer and a clinical lead for a multi-sector (acute, mental health, community, transport) specialist provider for children and young people for  around 3yrs as of now and general champion of the littlest guys which we all once used to be. `Children may not be little adults but adults are big children` being a principle we could follow quite broadly in data and informatics terms but probably more broadly in health and care.

Technically literate but not especially adept though that’s where the team work comes in.

### Abdelrahman M. Saad (aka Hadi)
 
My name is Abdelrahman M. Saad and I'm a final-year medical student working in the digital health industry.

It's my pleasure to be a mentor for Let's Do Digital. I call myself "The Geeky Med Student" because I'm always exploring new ways to use my skills in data science and AI, as well as my business acumen, to make healthcare smarter.

Currently, I’m working as a Clinical Informatics Specialist at REAP Holding (digital transformation), a Business Developer at Ebers (digital health and VR), and an R&D Specialist at CellClar (bioinformatics and single-cell genomics).

I have a rich background in training over 30 medical trainees, doctors, and students how to code and build their own AI models, from basic computer science and Python programming to advanced machine learning and deep learning. My journey also involves mentoring research teams on AI-related projects and collaborating with teams from Egypt, the USA, and the UK to help publish research papers that stand out in resumes!! 

Whether through clinical research or my entrepreneurial ventures like GeeksHub and the Radiology Intelligence Club, I’m committed to driving the future of medicine. I’m passionate about using AI, advanced analytics, and digital health solutions to improve patient outcomes and tackle the biggest challenges in the medical field.

### Sam McInerney

Sam, a medical oncology doctor at the Beatson in Glasgow, is also a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. 
His research focuses on integrating AI and electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROMS) into the cancer patient pathway. 

A life-long coder, before pursuing medicine Sam did a first degree in computer science and developed a keen interest in AI and neural networks. 
Following his degree he worked for several years in London’s investment banking industry, specializing in low-latency, ultra-high-performance trading systems. 

Sam graduated from St George’s University in London in 2006 after undertaking a graduate entry program into medicine, where Sam’s passion for building software carried over to his work in the NHS. Sam has built several applications since including an IOS app for clinical geneticists called 'The Genetic Counselling App' and most recently a system to automate clinic preparation. 
Additionally, Sam founded DoctorsThatCode.com, a platform that offers tutorials and a blog space to keep up with the rapid advancements in AI and its implementation within healthcare.
