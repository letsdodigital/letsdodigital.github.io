**Full Name** – Mark Bailey

**Job Title(s)** – Consultant in Respiratory Medicine and Clinician-who-codes, Conference co-producer

**Title of presentation** - Mark has been very interested in all things digital for most of his life. His digital interests filtered into his current healthcare role when he started thinking of ways to streamline daily clinical tasks. He built a desktop app called “Spiritum”. This houses the Gloucestershire sleep, bronchiectasis and tuberculosis services. It automates the transfer of data within the trust, creating standardised clinical letters, retrieves lab and radiology reports, flagging abnormal ones for clinicians to review, etc. As part of works to improve the sleep service, the Spiritum app helped reduce the breach rate of this service by 79% over a 2-year period. A spin-off from the Spiritum app was an program called “Quick Spiritum”. This uses robotic process automation to automate and speed up routine clinical tasks. These tasks include looking up imaging (eg chest X-rays), bloods and clinical letter and requesting tests and referrals. Quick Spiritum was found to save, on average, 30% of clinician’s time on these tasks. This work has shown what is possible with automation and digitisation, and Mark’s department is keen to tackle the next big issues. Mark and his team have been working over the last one and a half years on improving the local lung cancer pathway using the knowledge gained from the above projects. Mark has two computer science placement students working with him on this project – Joe Channing and Nick Ives. Mark’s team now have a functional “proof-of-concept” app that will be showcased at the Let’s Talk Digital Conference. This app has been created in open source and in a modular fashion. By using open source and a modular build, the hope is to be able to allow other disease sites and trusts to both benefit and collaborate on this work.

Mark is also a big advocate of advancing the clinical informatics speciality. He is a board member of the Faculty of Clinical Informatics, a board member of the NHS pycom (python community) and a current student on the NHS Digital Academy PGDip Digital Academy course. He hopes to progress this to an MSc in September.

**Full Name** – Sophie Brook

**Job Title(s)** – member of the National Digital Shared Decision-Making Council with NHSE, member of the LND local council, MSc student in Digital Health at UCL

**Title of Presentation** – Sophie is an NHS Clinician who created Lister due to experiencing frustrations from paper handover lists that still saturate the NHS regardless of digital transformation. She felt the cognitive overload of trying to remember and prioritise all patients within her care and the patient safety concerns of missed or overlooked tasks. This was coupled with the lack of transparency between tasks and staff members, with various roles working from different lists, leading to delays and inefficient ways of working. Motivated to solve these problems, Sophie was accepted onto the NHS Clinical Entrepreneur programme in 2019 with the Idea of digitising this process to improve patient safety, teamwork and workflow. Fast forward to 2023, Lister is now a developed task management solution and is currently being evaluated with 4 NHS Trusts.

Sophie’s passion for digital innovation has evolved over the years and she is a member of the National Digital Shared Decision-Making Council with NHSE, a member of the LND local council and a UCL MSc student in Digital Health. She looks forward to sharing her journey from NHS Clinician turned digital Innovator at the let’s Talk Digital Conference 2023.

**Full Name** – Grant D. Vallance

**Job Title(s)** – Information Manager for the Department of Clinical Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals Foundation NHS Trust

**Title of Presentation** – Clinical Services Providing Clinical Software

Grant originally comes from New Zealand but calls the U.K. home after being here for over 20 years. He has degrees in biochemistry, bioethics, ethics and the philosophy of science. He has worked in clinical trial administration and has done and still does academic teaching at the University of Oxford in ethics (mainly research ethics) and clinical trial protocol development. A self-confessed long-term computer nerd. His first computer was a ZX Spectrum 16k, which dates him somewhat. Perhaps being a computer nerd is the reason why, after a circuitous path, he has come to work in information management in a clinical department that looks after sick patients and not IT/informatics systems. He is a passionate believer in the view that the NHS should embrace and encourage frontline digital innovation where it occurs and particularly from within clinical departments. He has been fighting tooth and nail to do so and the struggle is the reason for his greying beard. Unfortunately, how the NHS and NHS Trusts do digital innovation is generally not very conducive to supporting frontline digital innovation. Consequently, he has some rather firm views on how this can be remedied…
