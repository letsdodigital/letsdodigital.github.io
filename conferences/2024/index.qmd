This year's key theme is **open**. That is **open source**, **open standards**, **open learning** and **open data**. But we are not talking socks, sandles and hippee like outfits. We are talking linux, internet and best solutions for an ever growing array of digital technologies used across the NHS and further a field. And we are looking for innovation at the clinical frontline. Please do join us either in person or virtually for a jam packed event on Thursday the 24th of October 2024 at Cheltenham General Hospital.

## Line up

We are currently building up the agenda. Our current line up includes:

* Stephen Rowley - Patient advocate and STEM career
* Paul Drake - Plastic surgeon, CCIO and clinician-who-codes at East Grinstead Hospital
* Nadia Kuftinoff - Senior Digital Delivery Lead, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire & West Berkshire ICB
* Simon Laftimer - Dermatology Systems Manager, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust
* Grant Vallance, Information Manager, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust
* Mark Bailey - locum respiratory consultant, clinician-who-codes and conference host.

## Feedback from last year's conference

**What did you enjoy about the conference?**

* The openness of the people talking about real problems and trying to address them.
* There was a good variety in topics and speakers. I liked hearing about real people who took an idea and built a product or implemented a change.
* The live feed worked really well. It was engaging and it helped me feel part of the conference despite attending virtually. Thanks to the team that made it happen.
* Really great chance to introduce myself to a new group of like-minded people, as I start out in a new direction in my career. Lively and enlightening debate session and follow-up discussion.

**Tell us one thing you learnt or took away from the conference?**

* The importance of the collaborative approach to developing apps and systems, having system coders and clinical staff (and end users too) both providing their particular expertise to the task is vital for accuracy and useability, and all having a mutual respect for each other's skills.
* There are good ways and less good ways to innovate. The challenge is differentiating them and meetings where a frank and open discourse can occur are essential for this.
* Getting patient participation is very valuable, and can help develop the system/process.
