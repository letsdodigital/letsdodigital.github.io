## Feedback from last year's conference

**What did you enjoy about the conference?**

* The openness of the people talking about real problems and trying to address them.
* There was a good variety in topics and speakers. I liked hearing about real people who took an idea and built a product or implemented a change.
* The live feed worked really well. It was engaging and it helped me feel part of the conference despite attending virtually. Thanks to the team that made it happen.
* Really great chance to introduce myself to a new group of like-minded people, as I start out in a new direction in my career. Lively and enlightening debate session and follow-up discussion.

**Tell us one thing you learnt or took away from the conference?**

* The importance of the collaborative approach to developing apps and systems, having system coders and clinical staff (and end users too) both providing their particular expertise to the task is vital for accuracy and usability, and all having a mutual respect for each other's skills.
* There are good ways and less good ways to innovate. The challenge is differentiating them and meetings where a frank and open discourse can occur are essential for this.
* Getting patient participation is very valuable, and can help develop the system/process.
