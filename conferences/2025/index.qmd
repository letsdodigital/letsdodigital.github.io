Hear about digital health education from the centre from **NHS Digital Academy Deputy-Director James Freed** and also the **National CCIO for NHS England Dr Alec Price-Forbes**. Join us to find out what forward thinking frontline clinicians have been building to help improve patient care. Hear debates about digital health education and interoperability. Finally, we have some amazing insights on how AI, when used correctly, can help improve patient care.

## Feedback from last year's conference

- I loved the whole event.
- I think it was very well organised, publicised and executed (on the whole). Great use of technology, the "vosters" worked, especially with the video presentations playing during breaks, the sessions were engaging and relevant, good speakers and variety of speakers, especially Nadia, Tom and Stefan.
- It was a privilege to attend for the first time, I learnt a lot from the sessions I attended, I thought the topics were spot on.
