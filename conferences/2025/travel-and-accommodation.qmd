**Parking:** The parking at the Painswick centre is very limited. There is free parking at `Stamages Lane Car Park` (see the above map).

**Train:** The nearest train station is `Stroud`, which is a 10-minute taxi ride away. Alternatively you can travel to `Cheltenham Spa` and take a taxi from there.

**Taxis:** If you want to book a taxi, we recommend using `Starline Taxis` from either Stroud or Cheltenham Spa. You can book them on [01242 250250](tel:01242250250). There are taxi ranks at Cheltenham Spa Station. The Stroud taxi ramp is a 1 minute walk into the town centre from the station, opposite Starbucks (see map below).
