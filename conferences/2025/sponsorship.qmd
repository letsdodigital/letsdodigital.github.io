The **Let’s Talk Digital Conference** is the main event in the calendar for those passionate about and working towards **better digital healthcare in the NHS**. We enable open debate about difficulties and real wins from those implementing digital change at the front line. This is a **great chance** for your company to engage with forward thinking professionals in the digital health arena. Let's Talk Digital Conference 2025 is being held on Thursday to Friday the 23-24th of October in Painswick Centre, the `Heart of the Cotswolds`. This is a **hybrid event**, with both online and face-to-face attendees. Previous years we have had **over 150 attendees**, both in the UK and as far away as Sweden and Brazil. This year’s theme is **digital health education**. The conference focuses each year on **great digital innovation and implementation at the frontline**.
