With extensive experience in terminology, standards, and the computer representation of medical concepts, Anders has dedicated much of his career to improving structured documentation and interoperability in healthcare. His day-to-day work focuses on vascular diagnostics and ultrasonography, particularly quantifying venous disease and enhancing computer-supported documentation and reporting.

In this session, Anders will share insights into Sweden’s approach to digital healthcare, discussing how data, standards, and technology are shaping clinical practice, diagnostics, and patient care. This will be an excellent opportunity to explore how digital health strategies differ across healthcare systems and what lessons can be learned from Sweden’s experience.
