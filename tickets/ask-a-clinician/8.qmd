Having spent nearly 34 years at NHS England—including nearly a decade as Clinical Lead—Michelle brings a unique perspective on how clinical insight and digital innovation can work hand in hand.

In this webinar, Michelle will explore her journey from primary care to shaping national digital policy, with a particular focus on interoperability—what it really means, why it matters, and how we can move beyond buzzwords to create truly connected, safe, and efficient systems. Drawing on her extensive experience in clinical safety (DCB 0129/0160), data governance, and digital transformation, Michelle will share candid reflections, lessons learned, and practical insights for anyone working in or building for health and care.

Whether you're a clinician, technologist, policy-maker or product designer, this is a chance to hear from someone who’s worked at the sharp end of care and at the strategic level of system design.
