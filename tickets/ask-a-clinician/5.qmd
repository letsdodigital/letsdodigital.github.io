Are you a data scientist, software engineer, AI developer, or UX designer working with medical imaging or radiology data? Perhaps you’ve asked yourself, "How does a radiologist approach an imaging study? Why does it take time to generate a report? What challenges exist in AI-driven imaging workflows?" Or even, "Why does the system sometimes flag things that aren’t there?"

This is the fifth webinar in the **Ask a Clinician series** from the Let’s Do Digital Team. If you’ve ever wanted to understand the mind of a radiologist or dive into the intersection of medical imaging and clinical AI, this webinar is for you.
