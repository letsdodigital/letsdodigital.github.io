Please join us for the first of many coding courses in healthcare that the **Let's Do Digital team** will be running. This course is open to anyone but has been designed for those working or interested in digital healthcare / clinical informatics. Module 1 is designed for those with little to no knowledge in coding. We will gently take you through what the command line is, how to run a command, how to program the basics, and even build your own web app (it is not as hard as you think). The programming language we will be using is [Python](https://www.python.org/about/). Python is a well-respected programming language that is very versatile. You can build simple programs at one end and run data analysis, machine learning/AI, and build extensive web apps at the other.

## Course structure

We now have 11 tutors and 41 potential students signed up (on the mailing list) for the event. We will have a mixture of presentations to introduce you to the topics of the module followed by hands on sessions, getting you coding straight away (you don't even need a coding environment on your computer, as we will be using a browser based solution). We will have break out rooms for the hands on coding sessions, with 4-6 students per tutor.


## When and where

Online, Thursday 27^th^ June, 2-5 pm, on Zoom.


## Topics covered

The below topics may sound extensive and "out worldly" to the novice, but do not worry. We will show you exactly what each concept entails and take you through worked examples to better understand and utilise each one.


- The terminal (the black window where you type in commands)
- Syntax (the coding grammar)
- Variables (where you store things)
- Comments (stuff to read later when you have no idea what the code is supposed to do)
- Control flow (if this then that)
- Expressions and operators (add these two things. Make x equal to 3)
- Functions (hay function, calculate the square root of 9)
- Error handling (you were trying to do what!)
- Web apps
- Medical calculators

            If you feel that £50 is too much for this 3 hour course with tutor support, then we offer a lower value of £25 per ticket. Before you consider this lower priced ticket, please do remember that a lot of time and effort has gone into creating this course.
