In the digital age, the balance between cybersecurity and usability in health systems is more crucial than ever. Geoff Revill will, in this webinar, delve into the delicate interplay between patient trust, clinician trust, and the security measures necessary to protect digital health information. Geoff will contrast the traditional trust norms in face-to-face clinician-patient engagements with the current digital realities, exploring how digital security models align or conflict with societal expectations.

Key discussion points will include:

* The impact of increased cybersecurity on system usability and the inherent trade-offs.
* Trust points in digital systems and their correlation with real-world trust dynamics.
* The often overlooked conflict between trust expectations in digital health solutions and the pursuit of user-friendly systems.
* Real-world examples and implementation challenges, focusing on how aligning digital trust models with real-world expectations can introduce barriers to adoption.

Geoff's aim is to engage all those involved in the patient journey in a conversation about where they see the balance points between trust and usability, and whether we are prepared to compromise patient trust for faster, cheaper, and more efficient digital health systems.

Don't miss this opportunity to explore the future of digital health systems and their impact on trust and usability.
