The ultimate aim of the DCSP is to streamline and automate the process of clinical safety documentation of digital systems used in healthcare. This work has initially focused on the UK DCB0129 and DCB0160 safety standards, but the DCSP is not limited to this set of standards or locality. The DCSP is designed to ingrain and also simplify the documentation and thought processes around improved clinical safety from the level of the digital system's code, through the Clinical Safety Officer and their team, and all the way up to upper management.

This webinar showcases a prototype of the DCSP, with input from the Digital Clinical Safety Alliance team and also Dean Mawson, a Clinical Safety Officer, on how this new system can help improve and streamline your safety documentation.
