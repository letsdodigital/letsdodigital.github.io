In the world of healthcare data, bridging the gap between clinical practice and digital solutions can often seem like an insurmountable challenge. Have you ever encountered a situation where clinical input in the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) left you baffled? You meticulously designed and implemented a system, only to find a doctor entering 'TBC' in a crucial field. What drives these decisions? What are the underlying factors influencing a clinician's interaction with digital tools?

This is the second webinar in the **{{< var ask-a-clinician-series-title >}}** series from the **Let’s Do Digital** Team. If you have ever wanted to ask a CCIO or pharmacist about their thought processes, workflows, workloads, or just, “What the hell were you thinking?”, this is the webinar for you.

Join us as Ramandeep, an enthusiastic individual, passionate about digital transformation and innovation explains how a CCIO and pharmacist thinks, works, and, somehow, messes up your data. Ramandeep's passion stems from her first role as an EPMA Pharmacist in 2014, and she is currently the Group Chief Clinical Information Officer at University Hospitals of Northamptonshire. She has completed the Digital Health.London Pioneer Fellowship Programme and Cohort 4 of the NHS Digital Health Leadership Academy. She is proud to currently be an Advisory Panel member on the CCIO Digital Health Network, a member of the BCS, RPS, Shuri Network & UKCPA.
