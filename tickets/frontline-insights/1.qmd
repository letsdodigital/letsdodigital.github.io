In this first of many webinars from the **Frontline Insights** series from the **Let's Do Digital** team, we are excited to hear from Andrew Simpson, Clinical Scientist at South Tees Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Sam McInerney, Oncology registrar at the Beatson Cancer Centre and founder of DoctorsThatCode.com.

Andrew will show us how **Internet of Things** (IoT), blood sweat and tears and a department that is open to innovation brought together both hardware and software to automate the heavy workload at the sleep department in South Tees. 

Sam will give us the low down on how he successfully used **robotic process automation** to streamline the detailed clinic preparation that is required of oncology clinic outpatients.

Andrew is a <abbr title="Health and Care Professions Council">HCPC</abbr> registered Clinical Scientist in Medical Physics & Clinical Engineering, specialising in Clinical Measurement, Clinical Engineering & Computing. Andrew has implemented an array of digital solutions to improve healthcare management. Andrew  is also the British Computer Society Teesside and District Branch Chair.

Sam is the founder of [DoctorsThatCode.com](https://www.doctorsthatcode.com/), a very interesting and informative blog series. He is an up and coming clinician-who-codes, and uses his dual speciality skills to improve the care he gives as a oncology registrar in Scotland.
