You now have the basics from Module 1. Time to progress your programming skills. In this module we get you to build a digital consent form. It is not as hard as it sounds. We will get you to do a process map on current paper based consent forms, and then create a process map for a much better (and faster) digital form. We will naturally help you through each step of the building and learning process.

## Course structure

 We will have a mixture of presentations to introduce you to the topics of the module followed by hands on sessions, getting you coding straight away (you don't even need a coding environment on your computer, as we will be using a browser based solution). We will have break out rooms for the hands on coding sessions, with 4-6 students per tutor.


## When and where

Online, Thursday 22^nd^ August, 2-5 pm, on Zoom.
