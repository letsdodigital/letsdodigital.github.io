**Let's Do Digital** has been a centre for safe and open discussion and learning around digital health since 2022. We have had two great conferences and several webinars to date. 

Our first **{{< var coding-series-title >}} course** is now open to registration. Please find further details about the course and registration [here](/tickets/programming-in-healthcare-module-1-June-2024.qmd).

Look out for another series of learning opportunities. We are planning to open the floor to computer scientists, data scientists, cybersecurity specialists, basically anyone in the digital domain who works in or around healthcare, to ask a clinician about their workflows, workloads, and thought processes. We hope to enable those in digital fields to better understand the data and information in front of them by granting them direct access to clinicians on the front line.
