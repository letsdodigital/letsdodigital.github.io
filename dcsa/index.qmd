## Plan

* Introductions (done)
* Current Process
* Cookiecutter DCB0129
* Hazards logging in code
* The Digital Clinical Safety Platform
* Feedback from a user - Dean Mawson
* Questions and Answers

# Current Clinical Safety Documentation {background-image="/media/clinical-safety-hazard-log.jpeg" background-opacity="0.2" background-position="top"}

## Clinical safety standards

* IEC 62304
* DCB 0129
* DCB 0160
* ...

## A mixture of everyday office softwares

* Word processor, eg [
NHS-E Clinical risk management system template](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/clinical-safety/documentation#:~:text=Clinical%20risk%20management%20system,DOCX%2068%20KB)
* Spreadsheet, eg [NHS-E DCB 0129 Compliance Assessment](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/data-and-information/information-standards/standards-and-collections/dcb-0129-compliance-assessment-v5.0.xlsx) and [NHS-E hazard logs](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/services/clinical-safety/clinical_safety_hazard_log_template.xlsx)
* Kanban boards (eg Jira)
* Process mapping (eg Moqups)
* Home grown systems


# Cookiecutter DCB0129 {background-image="/media/cookie-cutter.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

https://github.com/digital-clinical-safety-alliance/dcb0129-mkdocs-template


## Overview of Cookiecutter-DCB0129

* Created by Dr Marcus Baw.
* Used during clinical safety documentation of the RCPCH **Digital Growth Chart** APIs.


## Overview of Cookiecutter-DCB0129

* Stores safety documentation on **GitHub** (public or private).
* Uses **markdown templates** to build safety documentations.
* Builds a **static web page** of the safety documents.
* These can be *downloaded* into a PDF form.
* Website served via **GitHub Pages**.
* Automatically generate **hazard labels** via GitHub actions.


## Pros and Cons of Cookiecutter-DCB0129

**Pros**

* Automates a large amount of the documentation process.
* Creates easy to access, open and online documentation.

**Cons**

* Requires programming knowledge to setup and change.
* Basic command line interface only.


## Terminal based

# Hazards logging in code {background-image="/media/php-code.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}


## DevSecRegOps

**A framework for aiding security and compliance in modern healthcare software development**

* A dissertation by Joe Channing, May 2023.
* **Dev**elopment-**Sec**urity-**Reg**ulations-**Op**eration**s** Framework.
* Taking DevOps and aligning with security testing and healthcare regulations.

## DevSecRegOps overview

* **Integrating** regulatory compliance as part of the c**ontinuous integration / continuous deployment** workflow.
* Enables compliance to **keep up** with the fast pace of development seen with DevOps.
* Obtain **collaboration and integration of software developers** in the building of safer software for healthcare.
* Hazard logging in code.
* Hazards and their mitigations in code are version controlled, which provides a robust **audit trail**.

## Hazard logging in code

![](/media/hazard-logging-in-code.png){.centre-full-image-drop}

## Cons

* Safety officers and those working in close collaboration may need to be able to read code.
* Training of software developers in clinical risk management.

**However, this is short term pain for long term gain, as we would ultimately be building better and safer systems.**


# Hazard Types in Code {background-image="/media/danger-strong-current.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}


## Standardise Hazards Types

* Based on built-in exceptions (errors) types in Python.
* Most programming languages have exceptions types.

*exception* **KeyError**

*exception* **MemoryError**

*exception* **RuntimeError**

## Possible Hazard Types

* Up for debate...

# The Digital Clinical Safety Platform {background-image="/media/dcsp.png" background-opacity="0.2"}


## Overview

* The **Digital Clinical Safety Alliance** was formed to create a new clinical safety documentation system.
* **Takes the best** of CookieCutter-DCB0129 and DevSecRegOps.
* Streamline and automate safety documentation.
* Easy to use user-interface.
* Use templates.
* Adaptable to any safety standard.
* Audit trail.


## Live demo {background-image="/media/large-screen-presentation-conference.jpg" background-opacity="0.6" background-position="bottom"}


# Bringing all of the players into the same room {background-image="/media/wall-climbing.jpg" background-opacity="0.2" background-position="top"}


## Over the wall {background-image="/media/wall-climbing.jpg" background-opacity="0.2" background-position="top"}

* Traditionally, the team that developed an app, the **development** team, create said app and then ship the app to the **operations** team, who then in turn prepare the app for use in production.
* This was very inefficient, as there was a lot of **throwing over a bureaucratic wall**, back and forth to fix bugs and make production ready.


## DevOps was born

* To stop this back and forth between teams, the teams were merged together in the **DevOps** team. 
* And then the security team was added, and so we have DevSecOps.


## Healthcare needs regulation

* As healthcare is tightly regulated, regulation should also be incorporated into the DevOps team, alongside security:
