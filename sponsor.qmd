There is a hard working team behind the **Let's Do Digital** name. If you feel we are doing a great job and want to help support us with our projects and teaching courses, then please do consider `buying us a coffee`:

```{=html}
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; transform: scale(0.8);">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/button.prod.min.js" data-name="bmc-button" data-slug="letsdodigital" data-color="#FFDD00" data-emoji="☕"  data-font="Cookie" data-text="Buy me a coffee" data-outline-color="#000000" data-font-color="#000000" data-coffee-color="#ffffff" ></script>
</div>

```
