We had our very first Let’s Do Digital Quarterly meeting. This was an idea I had from a colleague of mine from the University of Gloucestershire. This was a great meeting, talking about the future of digital innovation at the frontline, showcased a few ongoing projects in quick fire 3 min sessions and opened to the floor and discussed the issues around innovation at the frontline in the NHS. The recording from the session can be found at the below link:
