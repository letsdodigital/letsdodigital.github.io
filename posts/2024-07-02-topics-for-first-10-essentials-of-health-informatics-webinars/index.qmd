Where to start?

So a number of you have heard me talk about the Handbook of Clinical informatics for a while now, either on Discourse or LinkedIn (eg this [post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7204555745709731841/)). It is a learning resource I wish I had when I started out in Clinical Informatics in 2017. There has been a lot of interest in the handbook idea, and I have been working on the best way to deliver it for anyone interested in using it (myself included). I have had a lot of discussions about how to create the handbook. Here are my thoughts so far…

First of all, to be more inclusive, and also to get away from the notion of this being only a printed resource, we have renamed the resource to `Essentials of Health Informatics`, and we will be using the term `guide` rather than “handbook”.

I would love to be able to create this guide for free, but it is very difficult to get busy clinicians and digital folk to do things that are not paid around their busy working weeks (myself included). I have worked on the idea for a while, and I was thinking of the below delivery plan.

We would offer 10 paid for webinars to start with (later expanding on this), with the material from these webinars being used to create chapters in the handbook (which will be online and open source) and also exam questions. Dr Trefor Roscoe has kindly offered his services to chair these webinars. He has many years of experience of teaching clinical informatics.

I would love to hear what topics people think should be covered in the first 10 webinars. Please select up to 10 topics you would like to see in these first webinars and hit submit.
