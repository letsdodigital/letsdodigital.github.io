I have just had a fantastic meeting with my colleagues at Gloucestershire University. We have been lucky enough to have 5 new MSc students join the University to study by research the new health tech course. This is very exciting news, and I look forward to hearing about their work soon. Interesting areas they will cover include:

* Gamification for helping patients with mental health issues
* Table top games for mental health and social interactions
* Radiology
* Health care network security
* Using technology to help manage dyslexia in complicated health procedures

I look forward to talking more with the students and for people to hear more about their amazing work. I hope to get some, if not all, of the students to the next Letâ€™s Do Digital quarterly meeting in Feb/March 2023.

Want to get involved, find out more about the MSc in Health Tech or even apply for the MSc, please contact Thiago Viana at tviana1@glos.ac.uk.
