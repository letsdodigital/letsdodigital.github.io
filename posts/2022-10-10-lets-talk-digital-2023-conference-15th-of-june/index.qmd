The most recent inaugural Letâ€™s Talk Digital Conference in March this year was a great success. We are now planning the next conference. This was originally going to be Thursday the 18th of May, but due to room booking issues, we have had to move the date. The 2023 conference will now be on:

**Thursday 15th of June, 2023**

We will keep you up to date on the programm!
