As promised (and in keeping with Discourse policy), here are the results from the above survey. Of 42 topics, we had 35 votes. The top ten topics voted for are as below. @TreforR and me have almost completed the line up of speakers (authors) for the webinars and chapters. We will be delivering these topics as paid-for-webinars, with the teachings from these webinars going towards writing the free to use and online Essentials in Health Informatics guide.
