As promised, here are the results from the top 10 topics for the **Essentials in Health Informatics** guide (as described [here](../2024-07-02-topics-for-first-10-essentials-of-health-informatics-webinars/)). Of 42 topics, we had 35 votes. The top ten topics voted for are as below. **Trefor Roscoe** and me have almost completed the line up of speakers (authors) for the webinars and chapters. We will be delivering these topics as paid-for-webinars, with the teachings from these webinars going towards writing the free to use and online Essentials in Health Informatics guide.
