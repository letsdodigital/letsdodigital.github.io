We have had two great conferences and several webinars to date.\nWe now plan to deliver several teaching sessions on coding (programmatic, not terminologies). Additionally, we are planning to open the floor to computer scientists, data scientists, cybersecurity specialists, basically anyone in the digital domain who works in or around healthcare, to ask a clinician about their workflows, workloads, and thought processes. We hope to enable those in digital fields to better understand the data and information in front of them by granting them direct access to clinicians on the front line.\nWe will update you as these courses and webinars are open to registration."

    "section": "Let’s Talk About Careers in Clinical Informatics and White Swans",
    "text": "Let’s Talk About Careers in Clinical Informatics and White Swans\nSo I am not one to write blogs about my thoughts, mainly just updates on meetings I am hosting. Today things are different! Let’s talk about careers and swans.\nAs many of you may know, I am a council member of the Faculty of Clinical Informatics (FCI). A fair number of you will know that we had our member’s conference on the 1st of December in London. This was a fantastic meeeting, with lots of great talks about the new FCI strategy, great projects happening across the UK and also a great session about good digital innovation (something close to my heart). It was lovely to meet up with friends and colleagues, and plan for the future ahead.\nNow, the low point for me at the member’s conference was the fact that the closing drinks reception were sponsored by a company named Palantir. I do not want to distract from the title of this blog, but let’s just say that I was not best impressed by the FCI’s decision (which I was not party to) to accept monies from said company. The only reason that I bring it up is that 9 of the conference members (me included) decided that we did not want to put drinks to lips sponsored by a company with a shady history. So what did we do, we had a splinter off party down the local pub, the White Swan.\nNow this is where the story got interesting. So a number of us got talking about the conference, the sponsored drinks and then after a few more pints, career opportunies for junior doctors (I happened to be sitting with doctors). This is where it struck me; the conversations I was having with 3 of the 9 splinter-group-go-pub members reminded me that I was exactly in their position just 12 months ago! 12 months ago I started looking for a new job in digital innovation after getting very little traction with the digital team in my current role. I am not talking about a new role in the more political positions in the NHS, which I feel a lot of people aspire to (rightly or wrongly), but I mean clinicians-who-code positions!\nI’ll come back to the clinicians-who-code remark.\nWhat I realised when I spoke to Anita Phung, Michael Kriger and Alistair Cannon down the White Swan is that it is hard being a passionate, detail-focused clinician that both deeply understands the clinical aspects of a digital build but also has in depth knowledge of how digital really works, how you can programmatically code it, what it can and cannot do and just make things better for frontline staff. The latter remark is what drives me to make digital healthcare great! It is something that I have done now for the last 3 years with different apps I have build for my current respiratory department and it is something I want to continue doing. I am lucky! I have just been offered a job in industry with the forward thinking Sleepstation / Born Digital Health company. I previously referred insomnia patients to them, and now I will be helping them with my knowledge of sleep medicine and digital medicine. However, many junior clinicians do not get this kind of break!\nNow, let’s talk about clinicians-who-code. There is no exact definition for this, and I have had many conversation about improving on the name. What I have settled for is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinician-who-codes\n\n\n\nSomeone that understands, in deepth, the clinical area being studied and the coding language that is needed to provide great digital innovation to said clinical area. One does not need a formal clinical qualification to satisfy the “clinical” part of this name.\n\n\nSo you don’t need to be a doctor, nurse, pharmacist, midwife, etc, etc to be a clinician-who-codes, just someone that has learnt about the clinical area that needs digital improvement and then can apply said improvement using their digital knowledge (from a code upwards approach). My friend and colleague Grant Vallance nicely fits this bill.\nSo anyone can be a clinician-who-codes really, it is just about mindset and learning. I would argue (but of course I would as I am one) that we needs 100s, if not 1000s of clinicians-who-code in the NHS to tackle bad digital implementations, break them down, rebuild them and build anew. We need digital systems that improve patient management, experience and outcomes. We need systems that reduce the workloads and improve the workflows of our fellow staff. There are too many digital systems used across the NHS that just are not fit for purpose. Let’s build from the ground up. Let’s get our junior doctors, nurses, pharmacists, midwives, etc, and those inspiring coders that just want to make things better into postions to do just that, make things better. We need to start having these conversations about how to do things better. We need to have career paths for our junior clinical informaticians that are not just aimed at high level managerial NHS digital roles. We need to use the passion that is so evident in these young people, provide them with jobs and just allow them to improve things for everyone. The ways we have been doing things so far in the NHS has had very variable results. It is time to let the new blood show us the way, we just need to give them the career paths to do so!"

    "text": "I have been recently looking into using Kubernetes for a new project I am working on. After a few hours of research, I was trying to find an analogue in the real physical world that minors Kubernetes. I thought large DIY stores seem to fit the bill. Then I thought I would ask ChatGPT what it thought of this concept. It seemed to be right on the mark.\nQuestion\nExplain kubernetes but in the form of a large diy store franchise\nResult\nSure, I can try to explain Kubernetes using a large DIY store franchise as an analogy!\nImagine that you are the owner of a large DIY store franchise. Your business is booming and you have a lot of customers coming in every day, each with their own unique projects and needs. You want to make sure that you have enough inventory, staff, and resources to keep up with demand, while also making sure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently.\nEnter Kubernetes.\nKubernetes is like your store’s management system. It helps you manage all the different parts of your business – from inventory and staffing to customer service and marketing. It’s like having a team of expert managers who can keep everything running smoothly and handle any issues that arise.\nIn Kubernetes, you have “nodes” that are like the physical locations of your stores. These nodes can be in different regions, just like your stores can be in different cities or countries. Each node has its own set of resources, just like each store has its own inventory and staff.\nThen you have “pods,” which are like the different departments in your stores. For example, you might have a plumbing department, an electrical department, and a garden center. Each pod has a specific function and set of resources, just like each department has its own inventory and staff.\nKubernetes helps you manage all these different pods and nodes, making sure that they are all working together efficiently. If one pod is getting overwhelmed with customers, Kubernetes can automatically shift resources to that pod to help it handle the load. If a node goes down, Kubernetes can redirect traffic to another node to make sure that customers can still access your store.\nOverall, Kubernetes is like the ultimate DIY store management tool. It helps you keep everything organized, efficient, and running smoothly, even as your business grows and changes over time."

    "text": "Following on from the inaugural Let’s Do Digital Conference on the 18th of March 2022, we have now had our first Let’s Do Digital Quarterly meeting on the 15th of June 2022. This had a great turn out, show casing of exciting digital innovation in the South West and great discussion. Once of the topics that arose from both the Quarterly meeting and the digital Summer School that I joined over that week is the issue of digital innovation happening in silos and people not hearing about what is going on around the country, how they can collaborate and how they can benefit from the works from others. Hence, during the quarterly meeting I raised the idea about a means to share these digital innovations with others. This would also be a place for people to submit their ideas and for a team of software engineers (hopefully hired directly within the NHS) to build and then also share their learnings and digital solutions. In some ways this is a new digital movement of frontline staff sharing far and wide, paying forwards their homegrown digital solutions, which will benefit all within the NHS. I am formulating the idea of a sharing platform."

This saddens me.\nI have pretty much defined myself as a CWC since I discovered digital health in 2018. It was back then that I started building different apps to speed up mine and colleagues clinical and admin workflows. I even got some robotic process automation in there.\nI would have given my left arm to study a Clinician-who-code course. Today, I am left with the feeling that a CWC course still needs to exist. I fully appreciate that no everyone needs to have in depth knowledge of both clinical and digital (aka coding) aspects of digital healthcare to be able to work in this domain. However, I see a lot of benefits of having a CWC on your digital healthcare team:\n\nA broad understanding of the intricacies of how computers work and how they can complement, rather than hinder, clinicians and their workflows.\nServe as a translator between digital and clinical teams.\nWhy not have the end-user on your team to tell you what is and what is not going to work!"

    "text": "2023 Conference\n    Agenda\n    Bios\n    Posters\n    Maps\n    Organising Committee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name – Mark Bailey\nJob Title(s) – Consultant in Respiratory Medicine and Clinician-who-codes, Conference co-producer\nTitle of presentation - Mark has been very interested in all things digital for most of his life. His digital interests filtered into his current healthcare role when he started thinking of ways to streamline daily clinical tasks. He built a desktop app called “Spiritum”. This houses the Gloucestershire sleep, bronchiectasis and tuberculosis services. It automates the transfer of data within the trust, creating standardised clinical letters, retrieves lab and radiology reports, flagging abnormal ones for clinicians to review, etc. As part of works to improve the sleep service, the Spiritum app helped reduce the breach rate of this service by 79% over a 2-year period. A spin-off from the Spiritum app was an program called “Quick Spiritum”. This uses robotic process automation to automate and speed up routine clinical tasks. These tasks include looking up imaging (eg chest X-rays), bloods and clinical letter and requesting tests and referrals. Quick Spiritum was found to save, on average, 30% of clinician’s time on these tasks. This work has shown what is possible with automation and digitisation, and Mark’s department is keen to tackle the next big issues. Mark and his team have been working over the last one and a half years on improving the local lung cancer pathway using the knowledge gained from the above projects. Mark has two computer science placement students working with him on this project – Joe Channing and Nick Ives. Mark’s team now have a functional “proof-of-concept” app that will be showcased at the Let’s Talk Digital Conference. This app has been created in open source and in a modular fashion. By using open source and a modular build, the hope is to be able to allow other disease sites and trusts to both benefit and collaborate on this work.\nMark is also a big advocate of advancing the clinical informatics speciality. He is a board member of the Faculty of Clinical Informatics, a board member of the NHS pycom (python community) and a current student on the NHS Digital Academy PGDip Digital Academy course. He hopes to progress this to an MSc in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull name – Marcus Baw\nJob Title(s) – Clinical Informatician, Software Developer, GP, Director at Baw Medical Ltd\nTitle of presentation – Debate: “This house believes that clinicians should be allowed to directly code and create health apps” For – Marcus Baw, Clinical Informatician, Software Developer, and other roles Against – Harold Thimbleby, Professor of Computer Science, Swansea University\nDr Marcus Baw is a practicing GP and Emergency Physician in Yorkshire, UK, with a specialist interest in health informatics and health technology.

She felt the cognitive overload of trying to remember and prioritise all patients within her care and the patient safety concerns of missed or overlooked tasks. This was coupled with the lack of transparency between tasks and staff members, with various roles working from different lists, leading to delays and inefficient ways of working. Motivated to solve these problems, Sophie was accepted onto the NHS Clinical Entrepreneur programme in 2019 with the Idea of digitising this process to improve patient safety, teamwork and workflow. Fast forward to 2023, Lister is now a developed task management solution and is currently being evaluated with 4 NHS Trusts.\nSophie’s passion for digital innovation has evolved over the years and she is a member of the National Digital Shared Decision-Making Council with NHSE, a member of the LND local council and a UCL MSc student in Digital Health.

First fix digital”\n\nHarold Thimbleby is an internationally recognised computer scientist and popular speaker who campaigns for improving digital healthcare. Harold’s book Fix IT: See and solve the problems of digital healthcare (OUP) won the British Medical Association best book awards in General Medicine; the BMA judges wrote “It is such an important book. Our ability to help patients is so reliant on IT and digital solutions. It has the broadest appeal and has achieved something quite impressive … It should be read by all healthcare staff.”\nAs an expert witness in NHS cases, Harold has helped keep healthcare professionals out of prison; he has also provided expert evidence in other cases, such as the UK Post Office scandal which prosecuted over 700 people for alleged fraud that was in fact caused by computer bugs.

Vallance\nJob Title(s) – Information Manager for the Department of Clinical Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals Foundation NHS Trust\nTitle of Presentation – Clinical Services Providing Clinical Software\nGrant originally comes from New Zealand but calls the U.K. home after being here for over 20 years. He has degrees in biochemistry, bioethics, ethics and the philosophy of science. He has worked in clinical trial administration and has done and still does academic teaching at the University of Oxford in ethics (mainly research ethics) and clinical trial protocol development. A self-confessed long-term computer nerd. His first computer was a ZX Spectrum 16k, which dates him somewhat. Perhaps being a computer nerd is the reason why, after a circuitous path, he has come to work in information management in a clinical department that looks after sick patients and not IT/informatics systems. He is a passionate believer in the view that the NHS should embrace and encourage frontline digital innovation where it occurs and particularly from within clinical departments. He has been fighting tooth and nail to do so and the struggle is the reason for his greying beard. Unfortunately, how the NHS and NHS Trusts do digital innovation is generally not very conducive to supporting frontline digital innovation. Consequently, he has some rather firm views on how this can be remedied…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name – Dr Mark Wardle\nJob Title(s) – Consultant Neurologist and Chief Clinical Information Officer.\nTitle of Presentation – 10 lessons from a journey through health and care data\nMark Wardle is a consultant neurologist and CCIO with a mission to build higher quality and safer healthcare services through open standards, interoperability and the use of meaningful data captured as a consequence of the processes of care.
