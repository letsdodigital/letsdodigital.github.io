## HTML Elements 

* HTML elements are the foundation of all content on websites.

* Elements are wrapped in tags, which use angle brackets (<>).

* Many elements have closing tags (e.g., </>), allowing content to be added between the tags to be displayed.

* The most common elements are headings, paragraphs, and divs.


## Headings and paragraphs

* Heading and paragraph elements are designed to contain text

* <h1>Hello World!</h1> the structure of these elements

* By wrapping text in element tags, you make it easier for screen readers to know the layout.

* It's also makes styling easier.

## Div elements

* Divs are used to contain content on a website

* Divs are best thought of as boxes, in these boxes we put in other content, such as headings and text.

* Then we can position the div and the content will move with it

* Divs are also useful for positioning elements inside them

* Adding elements to divs is known as nesting
