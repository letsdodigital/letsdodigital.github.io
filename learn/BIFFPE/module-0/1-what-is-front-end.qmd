## Front-end: An Overview {background-image="/media/denny-muller-JySoEnr-eOg-unsplash.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

* Every time you interact with a website using a browser such as Chrome or Edge, data is displayed onto your screen.
* Words, pictures, buttons you click, how it looks and what happens all creates a user experience.
* This is known as a **User Interface**, and is the core of **Front-End development**.

## Front-End: An Overview

* Go to this website (to be created) with your browser of choice, right-click, and select 'Inspect'.
* In the Elements tab, you will see a `<!DOCTYPE html>`, with a `<header>` and `<body>` section. In the `<body>`, you'll notice `<div>`s and `<script>`s are present.
* This structure represents the core design of a website.


## Front-End: An Overview

* **HyperText Markup Language (HTML)** provides structure in the elements, while **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** define the layout and design.
* **JavaScript**, written inside `<script>` tags, adds interactivity, making the page come alive.
* Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create a highly customizable and interactive **User Experience**.


## Why Learn Front-End Design?

* **Front-end is critical to user engagement**.
* Fast-loading, intuitive, and interactive websites drive up user engagement, reduce user errors, and increase the efficient use of databases.
* Skilled front-end engineering creates websites that are adaptable across various devices, from phones and tablets to PCs.


## What's in This Course

* Explore the basics of front-end design and development.
* Use **Git Codespaces** to create a simple website using **HTML**.
* Learn how to style and make the website responsive using **CSS**.
* After an introduction to **JavaScript**, we'll add interactivity with simple scripts.
