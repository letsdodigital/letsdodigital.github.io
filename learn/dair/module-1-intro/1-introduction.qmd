## Introduction {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Welcome to Module 1 of the **Data Analytics in Medicine (DAIM) - Images** course!
- Today, we will be discussing:
  - The clinical benefits of **learning to work with images**.
  - **Programming resources** that you can use throughout the course.

## Why programming in medicine? {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- The global market for AI in medicine has grown from
  - $0.2 billion in 2015 to
  - $13.7 billion in 2023
- **"The usefulness of humanâ€“AI collaboration will likely depend on the specifics of the task and the clinical context."** - "AI in health and medicine", _Nature_.
- Clinicians will be, and should be, **leading** both the **development and deployment** of these technologies.

- There is risk of harm to patients if technology is deployed **incorrectly** or **inappropriately**.
  - _"...almost half recorded instances of potential patient harm linked to their systems."_
- Involving doctors from the start helps integrate expert medical knowledge and safety at the core and strengthens the **advocation for patients**.

## Why programming in medicine? {background-image="/media/bundle-of-wires.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

- Most **translational bioengineering** or **informatics** research will use some degree of programming in **Python, MatLab, or R**.
- This skills allows for some degree of work across **clinical** settings and **academia**.

## 5-minute open discussion {background-image="/media/daim/question1.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

- What is the **top reason** that doctors should learn to program?
- What are the **disadvantages** of programming for doctors?

## Break! {background-image="/media/daim/coffee1.png" background-opacity="0.6" text-align=center}

## Python Environments {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- We will be using **Google Colab** for the workshops of `DAIM - Images`.
- Google Colab uses **Jupyter Notebooks** to run Python code.
  - **Easy to set up**
  - **Easy to use**
  - **Powerful**
- Many other biomedical coding resources use this environment, e.g. **Kaggle** and **AlphaFold**.

## Google Colab Window

<!-- TODO: Use marked-up screenshot of first workshop -->

![A screenshot of the Google Colab window for the first module.](/media/daim/module_1/first_workbook.png)

## Using Google Colab

- Variables **persist** between cells:

![](/media/daim/colab_cells.png)

## Using Google Colab

- A `notebook` consists of **cells**.
  - **Code** cells
  - **Markdown** cells
- When you run the first line of code, the **kernel** starts.
  - This is the **"engine"** that **runs your code** on the **server**.

## Trying out Google Colab {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- We would recommend **testing** Google Colab before the first workshop.
- We will provide a link to a workshop with **exercises** that you can try over the next 1-2 weeks **before the first workshop**.
- We would recommend testing out Google Colab before the first workshop.
- The default notebook from Google can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Resources to use {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- There are multiple resources that programmers often use when trying to solve a particular problem:
  - **Code documentation** - reliable and accurate
  - **StackOverflow forums** - real-world solutions with explanations
  - **Github code repositories** - code that works (mostly)

## Code documentation {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Documentation contains information about how to use the code in a library.
- It should be the first place you go if you **don't understand** how to use a function/class.
- Contains information about **arguments** and **use cases**.
- Search for the function (e.g. `numpy.shape()`) followed by "docs".

## Reading Documentation

<!-- TODO: is this formattted correctly? Are you wanting to have nested hyperlinks and images? -->

## Reading Documentation

![[The documentation for NumPy's 'shape' method](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.shape.html), a very commonly used NumPy method](/media/daim/np_shape_docs.png)

<!--
Maybe mention the difference between function and method here.
-->

## StackOverflow

- **[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)** is a website created in 2008 to allow programmers to **share programming issues**.
- There are other websites (**Stack Exchanges**) for other fields that have been created in the same format.
  - **[Medical Sciences Stack Exchange](https://medicalsciences.stackexchange.com)**

![](/media/daim/Stack_Overflow_logo.png)

## A StackOverflow Window

![**[A StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do-in-python)** about the `yield` keyword in Python.](/media/daim/stackoverflow_yield.png)

## Github{background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- A site where code is developed and hosted.
- Built around **Git repositories**.
  - Git is a useful tool to know about.
- Many answers can be found there by:
  - Looking at source code
  - **Github issues**

## Github Code File

![**[A GitHub code file](https://github.com/freddie-renyard/CT-Segmentation-UNet/blob/main/data_preprocessor.py)** for a simple CT segmentation algorithm.](/media/daim/github_ctseg.png)

## Github Issues

![**[A GitHub issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/27251)** on the NumPy codebase.](/media/daim/github_issue.png)

## Break and Questions! {background-image="/media/daim/coffee2.png" background-opacity="0.6" text-align=center}

## Clinical Considerations {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Some data is easier for computers to process than others.
- How can we make clinical data easier to work with?

## Clinical Considerations {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Standardised data formats
  - This allows for **interoperability** between systems and **facilitates research**.
  - **DICOM** is a successful example of this.
  - We will be discussing **DICOM** in **Module 2** of this course.

## Clinical Considerations {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Structured data:
  - Labelling data consistently.
  - Human-labelled data is often variable.
  - Use an `encoding` in your data collection protocol to make processing easier (e.g. "CXR" = 1).

```python
scan = "CXR"
# "chest X-ray", "chestXR", "cxr", "chest film", etc.
```

## 5-minute open discussion {background-image="/media/daim/question1.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

- Can you think of other considerations that can make clinical data easier to process?
- Have you ever encountered any issues with this in your practice?

## Google Colab Demonstration {background-image="/media/daim/question1.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

## Next Steps {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Over the next 1-2 weeks:
  - Work on the **introduction exercises**
  - **Get to grips with Google Colab**
  - Ask questions on the [DAIM forum](https://discourse.digitalhealth.net/t/data-in-analytics-course-forum/63765)
- Module 2 will start next week: **Core Python for Image Processing**

## Thank you! {background-image="/media/python-scales.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

Any questions?
