## Closing Session {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

* This is the end of **DAIM - Images** course!
* What did you learn?
* What are your immediate thoughts? 

## Refresher Core Learning outcomes

* Understand how computers process image.
* Understand how computers **learn**
* Diving deep into DICM vs. other image formats
* Understand types of machine learning
* Understand the trade-off's in machine learning / AI models.

## The Recipe

* **Coding skills** : You need not just ability to code but ability to troubleshoot, learn multiple languages. e.g., SQL, C#, Rust or improved fluency in Python
* **Theory**: PhD in Maths is not necessary (can be helpful to an extent!) but need to understand it's all matrix operations.
* **Project Management Skills**: Time management, customer management, agile working skilsl, communication skills
* **Clinical Translation**: You either possess domain knowledge or you work with people with domina knowledge

## My personal opinion

* You need all 4 of them. You may want to specialise into one of them 
* You may want to do most of the coding -> ML engineer. 
* Theory and Building models -> ML practitioner / data scientist 
* Project Mananger: might not even need coding skills 
* Clinical Translation: might be a doctor who understand how AI works and help procure right solution for NHS. 

## What do you want to do next?

* Sky is the limit! (In no particular order)

* **Machine Learning Engineer** : perhaps give yourself dedicated time to learn more theory & start building, will require data science x Engineering skills. 
* What do ML Engs do: translate real world data and real world models to "production"
* Skills: Fluency in Python, SQL, Docker Deployment, Networking, Optimising 


* **Machine Learning Practitioner** : find an area of interest, join a research team.
* What do ML Practitioners do: may involve in data cleaning, building models, help visualise 
* Skills: may chose to specialise into structured data (mainly tabular data) or unstructured data (images) or natural language processing (NLP)

* **Clinician with AI knowledge** : No extra steps but read more. Find flaws. Think how could this AI model fail and how it could fool you.
