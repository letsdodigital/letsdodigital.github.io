## Further material for module 2 {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

* TODO

## Further material for module 3 {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

* TODO

## Further material for module 4 {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}
 
* Try adapting a **different** model to the **same** dataset
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) runs competitions for machine learning tasks
    * There is a **wealth** of **openly-available** datasets to work with on this site.
* Further examples could include:
    * Adapting [this model (variational autoencoder)](https://keras.io/examples/generative/vae/) to generate **artificial** chest XRs

**Going Forwards**

## The Recipe {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

* **Coding skills** : You need not just ability to code but ability to troubleshoot, learn multiple languages. e.g., SQL, C#, Rust or improved fluency in Python
* **Theory**: PhD in Maths is not necessary (can be helpful to an extent!) but need to understand it's all matrix operations.
* **Project Management Skills**: Time management, customer management, agile working skilsl, communication skills
* **Clinical Translation**: You either possess domain knowledge or you work with people with domina knowledge

## My personal opinion {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

* You need all 4 of them. You may want to specialise into one of them 
* You may want to do most of the coding -> ML engineer. 
* Theory and Building models -> ML practitioner / data scientist 
* Project Mananger: might not even need coding skills 
* Clinical Translation: might be a doctor who understand how AI works and help procure right solution for NHS. 

## What do you want to do next? {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

* **Machine Learning Engineer** : perhaps give yourself dedicated time to learn more theory & start building, will require data science x Engineering skills. 
* What do ML Engs do: translate real world data and real world models to "production"
* Skills: Fluency in Python, SQL, Docker Deployment, Networking, Optimising 

## What do you want to do next? {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

* **Machine Learning Practitioner** : find an area of interest, join a research team.
* What do ML Practitioners do: may involve in data cleaning, building models, help visualise 
* Skills: may chose to specialise into structured data (mainly tabular data) or unstructured data (images) or natural language processing (NLP)

## What do you want to do next? {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

* **Clinician with AI knowledge** : 
    * Read more. Find flaws. 
    * Think how could this AI model fail and how it could fool you.
