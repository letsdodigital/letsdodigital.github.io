**Extending each module**
:::

## Further material for module 2

## Further material for module 3

## Further material for module 4 {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}
 
* Try adapting a **different** model to the **same** dataset
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) runs competitions for machine learning tasks
    * There is a **wealth** of **openly-available** datasets to work with on this site.
* Further examples could include:
    * Adapting [this model (variational autoencoder)](https://keras.io/examples/generative/vae/) to generate **artificial** chest XRs
