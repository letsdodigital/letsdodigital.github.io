## Introduction

* Welcome to the DAIR course!
* In the next 12 weeks, we will be covering a range of topics from basic data visualisation all the way up to machine learning
* Please let one of the team know if you have any questions during the course or any suggestions for improvement.

## Overall Course Aim

* To broaden basic Python skills into fully-fledged, practical experience that can be used to:
  * Do research
  * Build new clinical tools
* And most importantly, to directly improve patient care

## Overall Course Philosophy

* I set up this course as I want to accelerate the process of learning to code as a clinician after my own experiences.
* The massive range of resources online can be intimidating.
* Knowing how to improve can be difficult.
* We want people to leave this course with a toolkit to solve real world clinical problems.
* We also want to improve the quality of cross-disciplinary work

## Tips to gain the most from DAIR

## Break

```
def break_time(tired):
    if tired:
        return "Coffee!"
    else:
        return "We'll get going in 5 mins..."

print(break_time(tired=True))
```

## Course breakdown

* The course is split into multiple modules which each cover a different area.
* Each module is split into two types of weeks:
  * **Seminars** - Lecture-style discussions of the topic for the week.
  * **Workshops** - Workbooks that you will complete with the direct or indirect support of a tutor.
* The workshops will use Jupyter Notebooks within Google Colab to deliver the content.
  * We will not be covering local setup of Python environments.

## Module 1 - Tabular data

## Module 2 - Working with DICOM 

## Module 3 - 3D Printing for Medicine

* NB - May omit if too divergent from the rest of the material.

## Module 4 - AI for Medicine Part 1

## Module 5 - AI for Medicine Part 2
