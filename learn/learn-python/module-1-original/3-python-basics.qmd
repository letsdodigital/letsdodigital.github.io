## What are computers? {background-image="/media/yes-no-hands.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

- At its core, a computer is essentially a device that answers `yes-no questions`.
- It answers these simple questions very very quickly.
- By asking the computer millions of these yes-no questions, it can calculate answers to very complex questions.

## How do computers think? {.smaller background-image="/media/old-computer.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

- Confused by the last statement? Let me expand...
- Computers have lots of components to enable them to work.
  - Screen to show you its output.
  - Keyboard and mouse to allow you to communicate with the computer.
  - Inside the computer's chassis:
    - Hard drives
    - Memory sticks
    - Fans
    - Power supplies
    - Motherboards
    - Processors
- The processor of a computer is where all of the `thinking` takes place.

## How do computers think? {background-image="/media/old-computer.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

- The processor is where these `yes-no questions` are undertaken.
- The processor receives instructions in `binary` form.
- Binary is basically a string of `1`s and `0`s (eg 01001011).
- As modern computers communicate in binary (yes-no) form, they are said to be `digital`.
- The processor reads these binary instructions.
- Each instruction results in either a `True` (1) or `False` (0) _answer_ (aka `yes-no answer`). The `output` (aka _answer_) is also in binary.

## So how do we communicate with computers?{background-image="/media/digital-self.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

- So computers listen, think and talk in binary.
- We need a method to communicate with them, enabling us to get them to do what we want them to do.
- This is where programming languages come into play.

## Programming languages {.smaller background-image="/media/syntax-hard.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

- There are over 9000 programming languages, but much less than this in routine use.
- A programming language is written in _somewhat_ of a human readable form (depends on the langauge).
- Popular langauges include:
  - Javascript / typescript
  - C++
  - Go
  - Java
  - Swift
  - R
  - Python

## Translation {background-image="/media/keyboard-of-flags.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

- When you have written your code in your favourite programming language, a software program (called the interpreter or compiler) reads your code and translates it into `1`s and `0`s which the computer can then read and act upon.

# <span style="font-size: smaller;">OK, so you can write some code. What do you put in the code? How do you tell the computer what to do?</span> {background-image="/media/barren-land.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

## We will be learning python

![](/media/python-logo.png){fig-align="center"}

## The Python programming language{background-image="/media/python-logo.png" background-opacity="0.3"}

- Python is a scripting language interpreted and compiled at runtime.
- Its syntax emphasises readability and simplicity, utilising indentation for code structuring.
- Python supports various programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional.
- With a vast standard library and active community support, Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, AI / machine learning, and automation.

## Where to code?

- There are many integrated development environments (IDEs) for the python programming language.
- An IDE is basically a very fancy text editor where you write code, and run it (along with some other fancy stuff).
- There are several IDEs for python, two popular ones are VS Code and Pycharm.
- We will be using an online version of VS Code (called Codespace), so you do not need to install anything on your computer.

## What is in a code?

- You need different elements in your code to be able to tell the computer what to do. These include:
  - Variables
  - Operators
  - Expressions
  - Flow control
  - Functions
  - Error handling
  - More advanced functionalities

## Variables

- A single variable is a contained space in the computer's memory.
- Simple in-built variables include:

```{.python filename="variables_simple.py"}
a_string = "I am a string"
an_integer = 11
a_float = 8.04
a_boolean = True
```

## Variables

- More complex variables include:

```{.python filename="variables_more_complex.py"}
a_list = ["first element of list", "second element of list"]
another_list = [1, 5, 3, 6]
a_dictionary = {
    "1st key": "1st value",
    "2nd key": "2nd value",
}
a_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7) # fixed, cannot change
a_set = {4, 2, 5, 3} # can add new items
```

## Spaces

- Variables names **cannot have spaces**, if you add a space, the computer will read this as two separate variables:

```{.python filename="spaces.py"}
variable_a = "I am a variable"
variable b = "The added space will cause an error"
```

Syntax error:

        Cell In[1], line 2
            variable b = "The added space will cause an error"
                     ^
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax

## Double or single quotation marks?

- You will see people using 'single' and also "double" quotation marks.
- It does not matter which you chose, but be consistent. If you accidentally mix pairs of quotation marks you will get strange errors.

```{.python filename="quotation_marks.py"}
variable_a = "All good here with two single quotation marks"
variable_b = "I have the wrong matching quotation marks'
variable_c = 'Single quotation marks'
```

- Suddenly `variable_c` is part of the string for `variable_b` and also an error!

## Using both types of quotation marks

- You can embed quotation marks within each other

```{.python filename="quotation_marks.py"}
variable_a = "I want to highlight 'this' word"
variable_b = 'I would like to show you "this"'
```

## f-strings

- Useful to know

```{.python filename="f_string.py"}
age = 25
print(f"The patient's age is : { age }")
```

Output

    The patient's age is : 25

## Add strings together

- Or you can add strings together like this

```{.python filename="adding_strings.py"}
age = 25
print("The patient's age is : " +  age)
```

Output

    The patient's age is : 25

## Indentation {background-image="/media/steps-and-child.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

- Python is extremely sensitive to indentation. One extra space or tab in front of a line of code and you will not hear the end of it in terms of errors or strange results.
- Indentation (in the form of `tabs`) of lines of code shows the computer which previous line(s) of code it relates to.

## Indentation

```{.python filename="indentation.py" code-line-numbers="10"}
if drug_prescribed == True:
    if drug_given == True:
        record_drug_given = True
        print("Drug has been prescribed and given to the patient")
    else:
        print("Drug has been prescribed but not given")
else:
    print("Drug has not been prescribed")

print("Drug round complete!")
```

Output (if drug has been prescribed and given)

        Drug has been prescribed and given to the patient
        Drug round complete!

## Indentation

```{.python filename="indentation.py" code-line-numbers="10"}
if drug_prescribed == True:
    if drug_given == True:
        record_drug_given = True
        print("Drug has been prescribed and given to the patient")
    else:
        print("Drug has been prescribed but not given")
else:
    print("Drug has not been prescribed")

    print("Drug round complete!")
```

Output (if drug has been prescribed and given)

        Drug has been prescribed and given to the patient

## Naming conventions {.smaller}

- There are several naming conventions for programming languages. In python, conventions are:
  - Variables, functions and methods
    - `snake_case`
  - Constants
    - `CONSTANT_CASE`
  - Classes (a higher organisation method in python)
    - `CamelCase`
  - Modules (a file with python code inside)
    - `snake_case`
  - Packages (a collection of modules)
    - `lowercasepackagenames`

## Comments {.smaller}

- Comments are useful in explaining what code is supposed to do.
- They are essential for when you, and others, need to read your code later to problem solve or add to your code (10:1 reading to writing code ratio).
- Use them sparingly, as they can clutter code.
- Try and make variable and function names self explanatory.
- You can comment with the hastag or encapsulate with triple quotation marks:

```{.python filename="comments.py"}
# This is a single line comment
a_string = "a string"

""" Double quotation mark multiline comment
    Here is some more of the comment
    ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CLOSING TRIPLE DOUBLE QUOTATION MARKS
"""
def i_am_a_function():
    return True

''' Single quotation mark multiline comment
    Here is some more of the comment
    ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CLOSING TRIPLE SINGLE QUOTATION MARKS
'''
def i_am_another_function():
    return True
```

## Comments {.smaller}

- You will also come across something called `docstrings`. These are basically comments associated with functions / methods and classes.
- You will see them associated with modules as well (at the top of files).

```{.python filename="docstrings.py"}
def i_am_function(args1, args2):
    """A concise title

    A description of the function.

    Args:
        args1: I am the first argument to the function.
        args2: I am the second argument to the function.
    Returns:
        int: the sum of the 2 provided arguments.
    """

    x = args1 + args2

    return x
```

## Basic operators {background-image="/media/blackboard-and-equations.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

- Operators manipulate and compare data (which are stored in variables). Operator types include:
  - Arithmetic: `+ - * /`
  - Comparison: `== > < >= <=`
  - Logical: `and or not`
  - Assignment: `= += -= *=`

## More advanced operators {background-image="/media/blackboard-and-equations.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

- These include:
  - Bitwise: `& | ^ << >> ~`
  - Membership: `in   not in`
  - Identity: `is   is not`

# <span style="font-size: smaller;">OK, so you can create variables, change them and compare them. What next?</span> {background-image="/media/river-close-up.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

## Control flow - if statements

```{.python filename="if_statement.py"}
patient_allergy = "amoxicillin"

if patient_allergy == "amoxicillin":
    allergy_group = "penicillins"
elif patient_allergy == "tazocin":
    allergy_group = "penicillins"
else:
    allergy_group = "not defined"

print("Patient is allergic to", allergy_group)
```

Output

        Patient is allergic to penicillins

## Control flow - for loops

```{.python filename="for_loop.py"}
list_of_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for number in list_of_numbers:
    print(number)
```

Output

        1
        2
        3
        4
        5

## Control flow - while loops

```{.python filename="while_loop.py"}
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Output

        1
        2
        3
        4
        5

## Colons, look out for the colons

- All if, while and for statements must end with a colon

```{.python filename="colon.py"}
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## Colons

- The same goes for functions, methods and classes

```{.python filename="more_colons.py"}
def i_am_a_function():
    print("hello")
    return
```

## Functions (and methods) {background-image="/media/box.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

- Blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.
- Help in organising code and making it more modular.
- Part of the `DRY` (`don't repeat yourself`) philosophy.
- A `method` is just a function, used within a class (a higher organisational entity in python).
- A function:
  1. Takes zero or more input values,
  2. Undertakes some process, and
  3. Returns zero or more output values.

## Functions (and methods)

- Note the `def`

```{.python filename="functions.py"}
def name_of_function(argument_1, argument_2):
    a_variable = argument_1 + argument_2
    return_variable = "a return value"

    print (a_variable)

    return return_variable
```

## Functions (and methods)

```{.python filename="functions.py" code-line-numbers="2,3"}
def name_of_function(argument_1, argument_2):
    a_variable = argument_1 + argument_2
    return_variable = "a return value"

    print (a_variable)

    return return_variable
```

## Functions (and methods)

```{.python filename="functions.py" code-line-numbers="5"}
def name_of_function(argument_1, argument_2):
    a_variable = argument_1 + argument_2
    return_variable = "a return value"

    print (a_variable)

    return return_variable
```

## Functions (and methods)

```{.python filename="functions.py" code-line-numbers="7"}
def name_of_function(argument_1, argument_2):
    a_variable = argument_1 + argument_2
    return_variable = "a return value"

    print (a_variable)

    return return_variable
```

## Inbuilt functions

- There are some functions that are already built into python, eg

```{.python filename="built_in_functions.py"}
print("hello world")
print(len([0,1,2,3,4]))

```

Output

        hello world
        5

## Other things to be aware of {.smaller}

- There are several other organisational practices in python, but we will leave these for another day.
- Just so you are aware, these are:
  - classes
  - modules
  - packages
- There are also:
  - Some fancy syntax practices
  - Reading inputs from the terminal
  - File handling
  - Object oriented programming

## Error Handling {background-image="/media/insect-on-leaf.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

- Error handling is one of the most important concepts to understand and manage well. You will be spending 25-50% of your time `debugging`.
- `Debugging` is the practice of looking for bugs (errors in the code) and trying to fix them.
- When an error happens in python, an `exception` is raised. You then use the `traceback` to try and find the cause of the error.

## Error Handling

- If you know an error might happen at a set location, you can catch errors directly in your code:

```{.python filename="functions.py"}
try:
    variable = 1 + "a"
except:
    print("I knew that you could not add an integer and a string!")
else:
    print("Somehow I did not get an error!")
```

Output

        I knew that you could not add an integer and a string!

## The Traceback

- At first, this looks like a very complicated output

<div class="terminal-border">
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "/User/a_user/code/error_in_code.py", line 28, in <module>
                print(fruit_prices.get_price("pear"))
            File "/User/a_user/code/error_in_code.py", line 21, in get_price
                return self._price(fruit)
            File "/User/a_user/code/error_in_code.py", line 24, in _price
                return self.prices[fruit]
        KeyError: 'pear'
</div>

## The Traceback

- When reading a Traceback, alwas read from the last line upwards.

<div class="terminal-border">
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "/User/a_user/code/error_in_code.py", line 28, in <module>
                print(fruit_prices.get_price("pear"))
            File "/User/a_user/code/error_in_code.py", line 21, in get_price
                return self._price(fruit)
            File "/User/a_user/code/error_in_code.py", line 24, in _price
                return self.prices[fruit]
        ==> KeyError: 'pear' <==
</div>

## Compare the Traceback to the code

- Compare against the code

```{.python filename="functions.py" code-line-numbers="3,4,15"}
class FruitPrices:
    def __init__(self):
        # 'pear' key does not exist!
        self.prices = {"apple": 1.55, "banana": 2.44}

    def get_price(self, fruit):
        return self._price(fruit)

    def _price(self, fruit):
        return self.prices[fruit]


fruit_prices = FruitPrices()

print(fruit_prices.get_price("pear"))
```

## You got all that? {background-image="/media/coding.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

- Now it is your turn.
- Time for some hands on coding in `Lesson 2`.

## Computers are pedantic! {.smaller}

- **Remember** that computers think in `True` and `False`, e.g. `1` and `0`s. They are literal thinkers.
- Even one character being out of place can break an entire code base. So watch out for that `unpaired quotation mark`, look out for that `space` that should not be there, and make sure you `match your indentations to your if statements`.
- Now go have some fun in your tutor groups with hands-on coding and debugging.
- Come back to these slides to remind yourself of key concepts - [https://letsdodigital.org/learn/learn-python/module-1/](https://letsdodigital.org/learn/learn-python/module-1/)
