## What to build?

![](/media/egfr-web-app.png){ fig-align="center" width="max" height="max"}

## Streamlit

* We will be using a python web app framework called `Streamlit`.
* Frameworks are great, as someone else has done most of the heavy coding to make it easier for you to carry out a task (in this case building a web app).

![](/media/streamlit.png){fig-align="center"}


## Framework / Library import

`Direct import`

```{.python filename="libraries_1.py"}
import streamlit
```

or as an `alias`

```{.python filename="libraries_2.py"}
import streamlit as st
```


## Who is running what?

```{.python filename="main.py"}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

* Checks if the current file is being run as an imported library or directly


## Streamlit methods

```{.python filename="streamlit methods.py" code-line-numbers="4,8,11"}
import streamlit as st

# Writes text to the browser
st.write("Text to write to browser")

# Creates a text input field
# `step` is the increment for + - buttons
st.number_input("Label of input box", step=1) 

# Creates a select box
st.selectbox("Label for selectbox", ["first choice","second choice"])
```

## magicEnabled = false

* We have turned off a feature in Streamlit that shows all of your code in the browser using:

```{.python filename=".streamlit/config.toml" code-line-numbers="2"}
[runner]
magicEnabled = false
```
\
(See .streamlit/config.toml file if interested)

## Stopping a running program

CTRL - C

or 

CMD - C

## Warning! {background-image="/media/glowing-red-cone.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

* You are building an educational program. This is NOT to be used with real patients!

## Time to install a framework {background-image="/media/computer-and-phone.png" background-opacity="0.3"}

* You now need to install the Streamlit framework. Don't worry, it is very easy:

```{.bash}
$ cd lesson_3
$ pip install streamlit
```

* And now run this code:

```{.bash}
$ streamlit run exercise_1.py
```

# Now off you go! {background-image="/media/man-at-starting-line.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}
