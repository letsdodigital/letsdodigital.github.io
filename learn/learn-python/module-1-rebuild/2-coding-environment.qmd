# The coding environment {background-image="/media/bamboo-woods.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}


## Today's hands-on sessions {background-image="/media/bamboo-woods.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

* We will be using the GitHub `Codespace` development environment.
* This is a browser version of the well known desktop `VS Code` development environment.

# Useful terminal (shell) commands

## Using the terminal {.smaller}

* Also called the `command line interface` (`CLI`) or the `shell`.

Steps:

* `Select the terminal` (aka click on it).
* `Type in your command` (this needs to be typed out **exactly**).
* `Press enter` to run the command.

Pro tip:

* If you want to run a previously run command, you can select it with the &#8593; and 
&#8595; arrow keys on the keyboard.


## Altering the command to run

* Use the &#8592; and &#8594; arrows to move the cursor on the terminal line (the mouse does not allow you to move the cursor). Then make any corrections with backspace and keystrokes as needed.
* For example to change

```{.bash}
$ streamlit run exercise_1.py
```

to

```{.bash}
$ streamlit run exercise_2.py
```


## List files and folders command

* The `ls` command.

## Change directory command

* The `cd` command.
* `cd ..` takes you back to the previous (parent) folder.

## Where am I?

* `pwd` is the `print working directory` command.
