## We will be learning python

## The Python programming language {background-image="/media/python-logo.png" background-opacity="0.3"}

* A programming language interpreted and compiled at runtime.
* Its syntax emphasises readability and simplicity. 
* It utilising indentation for code structuring.
* Widely used for web development, data analysis, AI / machine learning, and automation.


## Reminder of the basics

* If you want a reminder of the basics, please visit the `module 0` slides at [https://letsdodigital.org/learn/learn-python/module-0/3-python-basics.html](https://letsdodigital.org/learn/learn-python/module-0/3-python-basics.html).


# Let's get serious

## Classes

dot operator

## Libraries

## Import the important stuff


## You got all that? {background-image="/media/coding.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

* Now it is your turn.
* Time for some hands on coding in `Lesson 2`.


## Computers are pedantic! {.smaller}

* **Remember** that computers think in `True` and `False`, e.g. `1` and `0`s. They are literal thinkers. 
* Even one character being out of place can break an entire code base. So watch out for that `unpaired quotation mark`, look out for that `space` that should not be there, and make sure you `match your indentations to your if statements`.
* Now go have some fun in your tutor groups with hands-on coding and debugging.
* Come back to these slides to remind yourself of key concepts - [https://letsdodigital.org/learn/learn-python/module-1/](https://letsdodigital.org/learn/learn-python/module-1/)


## Lesson 1 {.smaller}

* Make sure you have a GitHub account.
* Join your tutor group in the named `Zoom break out rooms`.
* Go to the page at [https://github.com/letsdodigital/coding-hands-on](https://github.com/letsdodigital/coding-hands-on)
* Click on the `<> Code` button and then the `Codespaces` tab.
* Click on `Create codespace on main`

## Ignore the extensions

* Ignore when a small window in the bottom right that pops up. Just close these.


## Get to your first lesson {.smaller}

* Change the directory (don't type the `$`. This is just how we show this is the command line):

```{.bash}
    $ cd programming_in_healthcare/module_1
```

* And then

```{.bash}
    $ python lesson_1.py
```

* Did it work? If so, open up the lesson_1.py file.
* Any problems, just ask your tutor for help. 
* **There is no such thing as a stupid question, only the question left unanswered.**
* We will give you 30 minutes for lesson 1.
