## What is Jupyter Notebook?

* Jupyter Notebook is an interactive tool for writing and running code
* Used mostly for Python but supports other languages
* Combines code, text, and visualizations in one place
* Widely used for data science, research, and teaching


## Key Features of Jupyter Notebook

* Write and execute code in small sections (cells)
* Mix code with explanations, images, and graphs
* Easy to visualise data with built-in support for plots
* Share work with others in a readable format


## Common Jupyter Notebook Tasks

* Run a cell: Select it and press `Shift + Enter`
* Add text: Use Markdown in a new cell and change it to 'Markdown' mode
* View results instantly: Print or plot results directly in the notebook
* Save your work: Notebooks are saved as `.ipynb` files


## Why Use Jupyter Notebook?

* Great for learning, experimenting, and prototyping
* Interactive: Run code and see results step by step
* Easy to combine code with explanations and visuals
* Ideal for data analysis, machine learning, and teaching


# Markdown {background-image="/media/markdown.png" background-opacity="0.4"}


## What is Markdown?

* Markdown is a simple way to format text
* You can use it to write headings, lists, and more
* Useful for adding explanations and notes in Jupyter Notebooks
* Supports basic formatting without complex code


## Key Markdown Elements

* **Headings**: Use `#` for titles (e.g., `# Heading 1`)
* **Bold/Italic**: Use `**bold**` or `*italic*`
* **Lists**: Create bullet points with `*` or numbered lists with `1.`
* **Links/Images**: Use `[text](url)` for links and `![alt text](image_url)` for images


## Common Markdown Tasks in Jupyter

* Add a Markdown cell: Change the cell type to 'Markdown'
* Format text: Type Markdown code and run the cell to see the formatted result
* Create headings, lists, or add links easily
* Combine Markdown with code cells to create clean, well-documented notebooks


## Why Use Markdown in Jupyter?

* Makes your notebook readable with clear explanations
* Organise your notebook with sections, lists, and links
* Perfect for combining code, results, and explanations in one place
* No need for external software to write documentation
