## What is NumPy?

* NumPy is a Python library for working with numbers and arrays
* Arrays are like lists but faster and more powerful
* Great for mathematical and scientific calculations
* Core tool in data science and machine learning


## Key Concepts in NumPy

* **Array**: A grid of values (1D, 2D, or more)
* Efficient for storing and working with lots of data
* NumPy makes math operations fast and easy
* Use NumPy for calculations across whole arrays at once


## Common NumPy Tasks

* Create an array: `np.array([1, 2, 3])`
* Do math: `np.add(arr1, arr2)` or `arr1 + arr2`
* Reshape arrays: `arr.reshape(2, 3)` (change shape)
* Find max, min, sum: `arr.max()`, `arr.min()`, `arr.sum()`


## Why Use NumPy?

* Very fast and efficient for working with numbers
* Easy to perform complex calculations
* Used in data analysis, machine learning, and more
* Essential for handling large datasets


## What is Pandas?

- Pandas is a tool for working with data in Python
- It helps you organise and analyse data in tables
- Great for working with spreadsheets or databases
- Widely used in data science


## Key Concepts in Pandas

- **DataFrame**: A table of data (rows and columns)
- **Series**: A single column of data
- You can filter, sort, and change the data
- Easy to read from and write to files like CSVs


## Common Pandas Tasks

- Load data from a file: `pd.read_csv('file.csv')`
- View data: `df.head()` (shows first few rows)
- Filter data: `df[df['Age'] > 50]`
- Save data: `df.to_csv('new_file.csv')`


## Why Use Pandas?

- Easy to learn and very useful
- Works well with big datasets
- Helps you clean and analyse data
- A key tool for data analysis in Python
