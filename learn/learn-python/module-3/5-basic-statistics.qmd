## What is SciPy?

* SciPy is a Python library for scientific and technical computing
* Built on top of NumPy, making it fast and efficient
* Used for advanced math, statistics, and optimisation
* Essential for scientific research and data analysis


## Key Features of SciPy

* **Linear Algebra**: Solve equations, matrix operations
* **Statistics**: Calculate probabilities, run hypothesis tests
* **Optimisation**: Find minima/maxima of functions
* **Signal Processing**: Analyse and filter data


## Common SciPy Tasks

* Import SciPy: `from scipy import stats, linalg, optimize`
* Calculate statistics: `stats.ttest_ind(data1, data2)`
* Solve linear equations: `linalg.solve(A, B)`
* Optimise a function: `optimize.minimize(func, x0)`


## Why Use SciPy?

* Powerful for advanced mathematical tasks
* Built for handling large datasets efficiently
* Works seamlessly with NumPy
* Widely used in scientific research, engineering, and data science
