## What is process mapping?

- Can be undertaking in a very elaborate and complicated fashion.
- However, at its core, you draw a flow chart that describes a process, either current, or a new one imagined.

## Why do process mapping?

- Can be used to excess and badly!
- But, it is a good tool to help think about the current problem and to help explain the current issues.
- Can help you form your new process. It can also give you a step by step guide to building your new digital implementation.
- However, beware, `digitising a bad process does not suddenly make a process better!`

## Where do process mapping? {background-image="/media/fibre-optics.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

- You can do this on paper.
- There are several digital process mapping tools like Microsoft `Visio` or `Moqups`.

# Remember

## Digital is not always the answer

- Sometimes the answer is just doing things differently to enable better.
- Don't think `Digital Transformation`, think:

```{=html}
<div align="center">
    <code>
Transformation to improve current processes, with the aid of Digital, if appropriate
    </code>
</div>
```

## We can spend a long time {background-image="/media/construction-site.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

- We could spend a long time talking about process mapping, and finding the best way to undertake a task.
- We could do a separate course on this if there is interest.
- However, let's get building...
