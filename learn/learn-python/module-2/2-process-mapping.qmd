## What is process mapping?

* Can be undertaking in a very elaborate and complicated fashion.
* However, at its core, you draw a flow chart that describes a process, either current, or a new one imagined.

## Why do process mapping?

* Can be used to excess and badly!
* But, it is a good tool to help think about the current problem and to help explain the current issues. 
* Can help you form your new process. It can also give you a step by step guide to building your new digital implementation.
* However, beware, `digitising a bad process does not suddenly make a process better!`


## Where do process mapping? {background-image="/media/fibre-optics.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

* You can do this on paper
* Today, we will be using an online process mapping program

* Go join your break out group. 
* Once there you will be given a link to an online process mapping program called `Moqups`.


## Specifically

* Choose one person in your group to create your process map.
* Spend 10 minutes in your group to create a process map of current paper based consent forms.
* Then spend another 10 minutes to think of the best digital consent form you would want and create a process map to describe how it would work.
* We will then reconvene at half past and talk through your results.
