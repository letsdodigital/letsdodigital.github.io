# Lesson 2 - Let's build a digital consent app

* What is a python virtual environment?
* What is OOP?
* What is a frontend?
* What is a backend?
* Streamlit
* Suprabase
* st_supabase_connection library
* What is an API?
* Tables and records, query
* Strange line dropping in VScode (linting, formatting)
* Recommend doing small changes to code saving, and checking what happens in the browser
* List comprehension, how to read and write them
* magicEnabled = false
* Queries get all data. Really should only get the data you need
* Streamlit.io reruns the whole script whenever you interact with the browser (eg click something, select something, type something, press a button)
* Sometimes you need to refresh the browser to get certain codes changes to work
* What is state
* field labels, keys, on_change, lists for selectbox
* Why the text field and selectbox outside of the form. Because Streamlit.io does not allow for dynamic update within forms before submitting
* Return nothing = `return`
* global variables
* field types
* What is a web browser
* What languages do we use in web browsers - JS, TS, HTML, CSS, more fancy ones (XML)
* what is a function, how to write one. (Anatomy of a function)
* Anatomy of the for loop. Loop variable. The use of `else` with for loops. `breaks`
* Don't forget indentation and colons `:`
* `all` statement
* Initialising variables

```{.bash}
streamlit hello
```

* create app.py and add

```{.python filename="app.py"}
import streamlit as st

st.write("Hello world")
```

```{.bash}
streamlit run app.py
```

* When you update the code and save, click "Always rerun" (top right) in the browser to always refresh on code change.

```{.python filename="----.py"}

```

```{.bash}

```

# Pit stop

* How is it going? 
* What are people getting stuck on?
