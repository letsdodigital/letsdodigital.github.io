# So what did everyone find?

# A possible process map for CURRENT paper based consent forms

## <span class="hide-title">Current process</span>

![](/media/paper-based-process-map.png){.centre-full-image fig-alt="A process map of current processes for consent"}

# A possible process map for a NEW optimised digital consent form

## <span class="hide-title">A new</span>

![](/media/new-digital-process-map.png){.centre-full-image fig-alt="A process map of a new and imagined processes for digital consent"}

# Remember

## Digital is not always the answer

* Sometimes the answer is just doing things differently to enable better. 
* Don't think `Digital Transformation`, think:

```{=html}
<div align="center">
    <code>
Transformation to improve current processes, with the aid of Digital, if appropriate
    </code>
</div>
```

## We can spend a long time {background-image="/media/construction-site.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

* We could spend a long time talking about process mapping, and finding the best way to undertake a task.
* We could do a separate course on this if there is interest.
* However, let's get building...

```{=html}
<div class="bottom-right">
    <a href="https://letsdodigital.org/learn/learn-python/module-2/4-digital-consent-form.html" style="color: lightgrey;">Digital consent form</a>
</div>
