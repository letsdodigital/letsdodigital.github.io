# The coding environment {background-image="/media/bamboo-woods.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}


## Today's hands-on sessions {background-image="/media/bamboo-woods.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

* We will be using the GitHub `Codespace` development environment.
* This is a browser version of the well known desktop `VS Code` development environment.
* In the context of this course, a development environment is synonymous with the `teaching environment`.

# Useful terminal (shell) commands

## Commands {background-image="/media/command-button.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

* A command is a piece of code that carries out a `specific task`.
* These tasks can be as simple as showing you what folder you are in, to printing, changing settings, and updating the operating system.


## Using the terminal {.smaller}

* Also called the `command line interface` (`CLI`) or the `shell`.

Steps:

* `Select the terminal` (aka click on it).
* `Type in your command` (this needs to be typed out **exactly**).
* `Press enter` to run the command.

Pro tip:

* If you want to run a previously run command, you can select it with the &#8593; and 
&#8595; arrow keys on the keyboard.


## Altering the command to run

* Use the &#8592; and &#8594; arrows to move the cursor on the terminal line (the mouse does not allow you to move the cursor). Then make any corrections with backspace and keystrokes as needed.
* For example to change

```{.bash}
$ streamlit run exercise_1.py
```

to

```{.bash}
$ streamlit run exercise_2.py
```


## List files and folders command

* The `ls` command.

## Change directory command

* The `cd` command.
* `cd ..` takes you back to the previous (parent) folder.

## Where am I?

* `pwd` is the `print working directory` command.

## Lesson 1 {.smaller}

* Make sure you have a GitHub account.
* Join your tutor group in the named `Zoom break out rooms`.
* Go to the page at [https://github.com/letsdodigital/coding-hands-on](https://github.com/letsdodigital/coding-hands-on)
* Click on the `<> Code` button and then the `Codespaces` tab.
* Click on `Create codespace on main`

## Ignore the extensions

* Ignore when a small window in the bottom right that pops up. Just close these.

## Get to your first lesson {.smaller}

* Change the directory (don't type the `$`. This is just how we show this is the command line):

```{.bash}
    $ cd programming_in_healthcare/module_1
```

* And then

```{.bash}
    $ python lesson_1.py
```

* Did it work? If so, open up the lesson_1.py file.
* Any problems, just ask your tutor for help. 
* **There is no such thing as a stupid question, only the question left unanswered.**
* We will give you 30 minutes for lesson 1.
