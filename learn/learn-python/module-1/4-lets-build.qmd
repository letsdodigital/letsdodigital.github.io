## What to build?

![](/media/egfr-web-app.png){ fig-align="center" width="max" height="max" fig-alt="Webpage of eGFR app"}

eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate

## Streamlit

- We will be using a python web app framework called `Streamlit`.
- Frameworks are a higher level of organisation of code above libraries.

![](/media/streamlit.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Streamlit icon"}

## Module import

`Direct import`

```{.python filename="libraries_1.py"}
import streamlit
```

or as an `alias`

```{.python filename="libraries_2.py"}
import streamlit as st
```

## Who is running what?

- A common practice is to use:

```{.python filename="main.py"}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- Checks if the current file is being run as an imported library or directly.

## Streamlit methods

```{.python filename="streamlit methods.py" code-line-numbers="4,7,11,14"}
import streamlit as st

# A title for the page
st.title("My first web app")

# Writes text to the browser
st.write("Text to write to browser")

# Creates a text input field
# `step` is the increment for + - buttons
st.number_input("Label of input box", step=1)

# Creates a select box
st.selectbox("Label for selectbox", ["first choice","second choice"])
```

## Streamlit methods

![](/media/my-first-app.png){fig-align="center" width="max" height="max" fig-alt="Picture of first app with some basic fields"}

## magicEnabled = false

- We have turned off the feature in Streamlit that shows all of your code in the browser using:

```{.python filename=".streamlit/config.toml" code-line-numbers="2"}
[runner]
magicEnabled = false
```

\
(See the _.streamlit/config.toml_ file if interested)

## Stopping a running program

CTRL - C

or

CMD - C

- If a major error happens, streamlit will not refresh and you will need to stop your program.
- You will also need to stop the program between exercises.

## Warning! {background-image="/media/glowing-red-cone.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

- You are building an educational program. This is NOT to be used with real patients!

## Time to install a framework {background-image="/media/computer-and-phone.png" background-opacity="0.3"}

- You now need to install the Streamlit framework. Don't worry, it is very easy:

```{.bash}
$ cd ../lesson_2
$ pip install streamlit
```

- There will be many lines of output in the terminal. Just wait for this to finish (30-60 seconds).
- And now run this command:

```{.bash}
$ streamlit run exercise_1.py
```

## Now off you go! {background-image="/media/man-at-starting-line.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

- Lesson 3 is for those that finish lesson 2 early (but it is not a race).
