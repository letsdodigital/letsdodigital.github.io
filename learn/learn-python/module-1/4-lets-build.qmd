## What to build?

![](/media/egfr-web-app.png){ fig-align="center" width="max" height="max"}

## Streamlit

* We will be using a python web app framework called `Streamlit`.
* Frameworks are great, as someone else has done most of the heavy coding to make it easier for you to carry out a task (in this case building a web app).

![](/media/streamlit.png){fig-align="center"}

## Time to install a framework {background-image="/media/computer-and-phone.png" background-opacity="0.3"}

* You now need to install the Streamlit framework. Don't worry, it is very easy:

```{.bash}
$ pip install streamlit
```

* Stay in the `module-1/hands-on` folder.
* Run this code:

```{.bash}
$ streamlit run lesson_3.py
```

## Warning! {background-image="/media/glowing-red-cone.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

* You are building an educational program. This is NOT to be used with real patients!

# Now off you go! {background-image="/media/man-at-starting-line.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}


* Hands on lesson_4.py for those too fast at lesson_3.py only
