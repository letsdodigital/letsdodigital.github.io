## Introduction {background-image="/media/welcome-sign.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

* Welcome and thank you for joining our course.
* We hope you enjoy the course and find it helpful.
* There are plans for further, more advanced courses, in the near future.
* Please provide feedback at the end of the course, so we can help improve things further.


## The coding environment {background-image="/media/bamboo-woods.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

* We will explore the development (teaching) environment.
* Get you connected to the development environment.
* Get you running some common command line functions in `Lesson 1`.


## Python Basics {.smaller}

* How do we communicate with computers.
* Introduction to the python programming language.
* Learn about:
    * Syntax
    * Variables
    * Operators
    * Control flow
    * Functions
    * Error handling
* Then get you programming in `Lesson 2`.


## Build an app

* Finally, we will get you building your own clinical app

## Why learn to code? {.smaller background-image="/media/why.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

* We learn biology and anatomy at university to better understand and practice clinical medicine. Why don't we learn the base subject to better understand and practice digital medicine?
* Of course not all clinicians should be expected to have extensive knowledge in coding and digital health; that would take clinicians away from the front line, and also clinicians are expensive coders.
* However, having a small number of subject matter experts in both disciplines can be highly advantageous to implementing better and safer digital health projects.
* Also, how can you be expected to understand how AI and large language models work if you don't understand the basics of how computers think?


## How can you use your coding skills in health care?

* Data analytics
* Building apps
* Interoperability
* Automate routine tasks
* Help lead a software development team with knowledge of both digital and clinical aspects.


* Indeed, anything digital

## Tutor groups {background-image="/media/teacher-and-blackboard.jpg" background-opacity="0.6"}

* Has everyone been placed in a tutor group?
