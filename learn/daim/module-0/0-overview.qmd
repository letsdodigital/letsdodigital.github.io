## Introduction {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Welcome to the **Data Analytics in Medicine (DAIM)** course!
- In the coming weeks, we will be covering a range of topics from **basic data visualisation** all the way up to **machine learning**.
- There is a lot of exciting material to cover, so let's jump straight in.

## Introduction {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

**As always:**

- Please let one of the team know if you have any **questions** during the course or **any suggestions for improvement**.

## Overall Course Aim {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- To broaden your Python skills into **fully-fledged** and **practical experience** that can be used to:
  - Undertake research
  - Improve clinical services via smart audit
  - Build new next level clinical tools
- And most importantly, to **directly improve patient care**.

## Overall Course Philosophy {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- I set up this course as I want to **accelerate the process** of learning to code as a clinician after my own experiences.
- The massive range of resources online can be **intimidating**.
- Knowing how to improve your coding skills can be **difficult**.
- We want people to leave this course with a **toolkit** to enable solving **real world clinical problems**.
- We also want to improve the quality of cross-disciplinary work.

## Tips to gain the most from DAIM {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- **Practice, practice, practice**
- Unfortunately, there will be times when learning to code can get a little frustrating. But remember, we are here to help you through these hurdles.
- Finding resources
  - Code documentation
  - Stack Overflow forum
  - GitHub code

<!-- TODO: Moved this before coffee break so people have some talking points -->

## Course breakdown {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- The course is split into multiple modules which each cover a different area.
- Each module is split into:
  - **Seminars** - Lecture-style talks and discussions of the topic for the week.
  - **Workshops** - Practical exercises via `Workbooks` to gain hands-on experience, guided by direct or indirect support of our experienced tutors.
- The workshops will use **Jupyter Notebooks** within **Google Colab** to deliver the content.

## 5-minute open discussion {background-image="/media/daim/question1.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

- Questions:
  - What incentive did you have for signing up for this course?
  - What is the one skill that you are hoping to gain?

<!-- TODO: I feel this is much too early for a break, you are only 10 mins into your talk -->

## Break! {background-image="/media/daim/coffee1.png" background-opacity="0.6" text-align=center}

<!--
```python
def break_time(tired):
    if tired:
        return "Coffee!"
    else:
        return "We'll get going in 5 mins..."

print(break_time(tired=True))
```
-->

<!-- TODO: You will need to expand on these learning levels. Why do we have them, what are they and how can students and tutors utilise them to help students. -->

## Learning Levels {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- We've created a set of learning levels **(LLs)** for this course:
  1. **Level 1** - Basic Practical Skills (coding skills)
  2. **Level 2** - Theory (modelling skills)
  3. **Level 3** - Project Planning and Management
  4. **Level 4** - Clinical Translation

<!-- Where is module 0 and 1? Please explain to audience, as you suddenly jump to module 2 -->

## Module 2 - Course Introduction {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Seminar content will include:
  - Aims and objectives of the course.
  - Overview of resources to use throughout the course.
  - Clinical applications of programming.

## Module 2 - Core Python for Image Processing {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Seminar content will include:
  - How images are **digitally represented**.
  <!-- TODO: make sure you tell the audience what a library is -->
  - Basics of multiple Python packages.
    - **PIL**, a Python library for working with images.
    - **NumPy**, a Python library for working with large structured data.
- Workshop content will include:
  - How to access and render **different types** of image data.

## Module 3 - Python and DICOM {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Seminar content will include:
  - What the **DICOM standard** is (think X-rays and CTs)
  - How computers represent scan data
  - What **data** is in a DICOM file
- Workshop content will include:
  - Opening and **rendering DICOM** with Python
  - **Extracting demographics** from DICOM

## Module 4 - AI for Medicine {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Seminar content will include:
  - Different types of **"machine learning"**
  - The practical steps needed to take **an idea to reality**
  - Discussing **advantages and limitations** of these algorithms
- Workshop content will include:
  - **Preprocessing data** for training
  - **Constructing, training, and evaulating** a basic neural network for **pneumonia detection on CXR**

## Course Timeline

- _TODO (Make this when the updated course layout is better specified)_

## Course Feedback {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_green_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- We will be asking for course feedback to allow us to refine the course for further cohorts.
- Please fill this out at the start and end of the course.
- Please include honest feedback! Only with honest feedback can we further improve this course.

## Note - Terminology {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_green_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- We will be using the term **"programming"** in this course to prevent confusion with:
  - Clinical coding - SNOMED-CT, ICD-10, etc...
  - Patients coding - crash trollies, etc...

## Thank you! {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_green_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

Any questions?
