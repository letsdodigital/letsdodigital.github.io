**NumPy Recap**
:::

## What is a NumPy array? {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Arrays

- **Definition**: An array is a **collection of elements** (usually numbers) stored in a **grid-like structure**.
- Arrays can be **1D (like a list)** or **multi-dimensional** (2D, 3D, etc.).
- Used to store and organize data for **efficient processing**.

### Example

![Visualisation of different array shapes](/media/daim/np_shape_1.png){height=400px}

:::

## Why use NumPy arrays for medical images? {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- NumPy is built on top of **C**.
  - Computations are much faster than in Python computations.
- NumPy arrays consume **less space in memory** than Python lists.
- NumPy is also **fast** because it uses **broadcasting**.

## Broadcasting {.smaller background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Definition

> Broadcasting is the ability to perform computations on or using arrays without the need to use for loops even if arrays are not of the same exact shape.

### Rules

- The arrays can be broadcast together if they are compatible with all dimensions.
- If the arrays don’t have the same rank then prepend the shape of the lower rank array with 1s until both shapes have the same length.
- The two arrays are compatible in a dimension if they have the same size in the dimension or if one of the arrays has size 1 in that dimension.
- In any dimension where one array had size 1 and the other array had size greater than 1, the first array behaves as if it were copied along that dimension.

:::

## Question {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue.png" background-opacity="0.6" text-align=center}

- Considering the rules of broadcasting, which would yield an error and which is compatible?

```{.python}
    (2,1), (1,) --->
    (5,5,3), (2,5,3) -->
    (5,5,3), (5,3) -->
    (3,3,4), (4,)-->
```

## Answers {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue.png" background-opacity="0.6" text-align=center}

```{.python}
    (2,1), (1,) ---> Yes
    (5,5,3), (2,5,3) --> No
    (5,5,3), (5,3) --> Yes
    (3,3,4), (4,)--> Yes
```

**Image Representation in DICOM**
:::

## Reminder {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Images are **2D** or **3D arrays**.
- Image pixels are often represented with **8-bit integers**.
- Colour images have three dimensions with **a 2D array for every color channel**.
- How does this change for **medical imaging**?

## Houndsfield Units {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Used in **CT Scans**.
- They describe the **attentuation of x-rays** through different structures.
- **Water** is used as a reference point at **0 HU (Hounsfield Units)** .
  - Broadly, materials that **attenuate X-rays more** will have a **higher value**, and vice versa.
  - Calibration can be done with respect to **water** or **air**

## Why is this important for programming? {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Houndsfield units are **quantitative** - they measure a **physical property**.
- Houndsfield units are typically represented as 12-bit or 16-bit integers.
- As previously mentioned, **most images are 8-bit**.
  - How can we visualise CT scans?

## Windowing {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Explanation

- Windowing is the selection of a:
  - **Centre value** (level)
  - **Range** (aka **width**)
- The **level** determines the **brightness**, the **width** determines the **contrast**
- HU values outside of this are not displayed.
- This allows for visualisation of different structures.

### Table

| Tissue Type | Hounsfield Unit (HU) Range |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Air         | -1000 HU                   |
| Fat         | -100 to -50 HU             |
| Water       | 0 HU                       |
| Soft Tissue | +40 to +80 HU              |
| Bone        | +700 to +3000 HU           |

**The DICOM Standard**
:::

## What is DICOM? {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_green_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- **DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)** is a standard for storing and transmitting medical images.
- It was developed to ensure **interoperability** between medical imaging devices.
  - CT and MRI **(stored as 3D images)**
  - X-ray and ultrasound **(stored as 2D images)**
- DICOM includes more data **about the image itself**.
  - This is called **metadata**.

## Metadata {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_green_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Other formats (JPEG, PNG) have metadata.
  - DICOM's metadata is **more extensive**.
- The metadata can include:
  - The patient's name, referring hospital, gender, etc.
  - Parameters of image acquisition such as slice thickness, protocol, position of patient, etc.

## Other features of DICOM {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_green_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- A key part of DICOM is **standardisation**, allowing a common framework for managing, storing, and sharing medical images across different devices and platforms.
  - This allows for integration into electronic health records and PACS (Picture Archive Communication System).
- Support for **lossless compression**.
  - Medical images can be compressed without losing valuable scan information.

## Break! {background-image="/media/daim/coffee1.png" background-opacity="0.6" text-align=center}

## Value representation {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_red_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Each item of **data** in a DICOM file has a **value representation**.
  - This is its **datatype**
- Common datatypes in Python include integers, strings, floats, etc.
- DICOM's **value representations** are more elaborate.
- These are important so that the programmer knows how to **interpret** data in the file.

## Examples of value representations {.smaller}

| **VR** | **Description**                                                | **Data Type**                |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **PN** | **Person Name**: Stores a person’s name                        | String (multi-part)          |
| **DA** | **Date**: Represents a date (e.g., study date)                 | Date (YYYYMMDD)              |
| **TM** | **Time**: Represents time (e.g., study time)                   | Time (HHMMSS)                |
| **LO** | **Long String**: Limited-length string                         | String (up to 64 chars)      |
| **DS** | **Decimal String**: Decimal numbers                            | String (decimal format)      |
| **FD** | **Floating Point Double**: 8-byte floating number              | 64-bit float                 |
| **UL** | **Unsigned Long**: 32-bit unsigned integer                     | 32-bit int                   |
| **SQ** | **Sequence of Items**: Represents a sequence of DICOM elements | Sequence (nested data)       |

**Working with DICOM**
:::

## DICOM Viewers {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- **DICOM viewers** are specialized software applications that allow users to **view** and **analyse** DICOM files.
- Examples of these include:
  - **OsiriX (mac-OS)**: Offers advanced visualization and includes metadata extraction features.
  - **RadiAnt DICOM Viewer**: A user-friendly tool that offers detailed views of both image data and associated metadata.
  - **Horos**: An open-source macOS-based viewer with powerful metadata viewing capabilities.

## Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS) {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- **Picture Archive and Communication Systems (PACS)** play a crucial role in modern medical imaging.
- They **integrate** with various **imaging modalities** and **DICOM standards** to streamline the **management**, **retrieval**, and **sharing** of medical images.

## Key Components of PACS {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- **Image Acquisition**: Receives and stores medical images from different imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, X-ray).
- **Data Storage**: Maintains a secure, scalable archive for large volumes of image data.
- **Image Viewing**: Provides user-friendly interfaces for clinicians to access and analyze images.
- **Image Distribution**: Facilitates the transfer of images and associated data across multiple locations, enabling remote diagnostics and consultations.

## What is the difference between PACS and DICOM viewers?

**Voxels in DICOM**
:::

## What are Voxels? {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- **Voxel** (short for "volumetric pixel") is the 3D counterpart of a pixel.
- In medical imaging, voxels represent a **volume** of tissue in a scanned 3D space.
- Each voxel contains a value that corresponds to the measured property of that volume, such as **tissue density** or **intensity**.

## Voxel dimensions {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Voxel size depends on the **spatial resolution** of the imaging technique and the **slice thickness**.
- Smaller voxels provide **higher resolution** images but may require more data and longer scan times.
- The size of a voxel is determined by:
  - **Slice thickness** (z-axis)
  - **Pixel size** in the x-y plane

## Isotropic vs. Non-Isotropic Voxels {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Isotropic voxels have **equal dimensions**, e.g. 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm.
- Non-isotropic voxels do not have **square** dimensions, e.g. 1mm × 1mm × 2mm.

![Example plot showing different voxel dimensions.](/media/daim/module_3/voxels.JPG)

## DICOM Tags for Voxel Dimensions {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- **Pixel Spacing (0028,0030)**
  - This tag defines the physical distance in millimeters between the **center of each pixel** in the image plane (usually in the X and Y dimensions).
- **Slice Thickness (0018,0050)**:
  - This tag indicates the thickness of each slice in millimeters along the Z-axis.

**Rendering DICOM Data**
:::

## Rendering Data {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- A 3D image cannot be shown on a 2D screen.
- How do you **display data** from a **3D volumetric scan**?

![What the voxels in a chest CT scan look like when plotted as a volume. (Source: TCIA Database (see references))](/media/daim/module_3/3Dvis.png)

## Displaying an image {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- **Sections** of an image can be displayed instead.
- These can correspond to the **x, y, and z imaging dimensions**.
  - Coronal, sagittal and axial planes
- In Python, these can be extracted by **array slicing**.

## Segmentation {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

- Segmentation is **pixel-level classification** where each pixel is classified to belong to a **certain class**.
  - **e.g. is this pixel part of the liver?**
- This can be useful in many settings including automated image analysis and object rendering.

## Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) {background-image="/media/daim/bg_cubes_blue_right.png" background-opacity="0.6"}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Explanation

- **Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP)** is a method used to visualize 3D volumetric data.
- It projects the maximum values (HUs) along each line of sight onto a 2D plane.
- Often used in **positron emission tomography (PET) imaging** and for **vessel assessment** in angiography.
