His digital interests filtered into his current healthcare role when he started thinking of ways to streamline daily clinical tasks. He built a desktop app called “Spiritum”. This houses the Gloucestershire sleep, bronchiectasis and tuberculosis services. It automates the transfer of data within the trust, creating standardised clinical letters, retrieves lab and radiology reports, flagging abnormal ones for clinicians to review, etc. As part of works to improve the sleep service, the Spiritum app helped reduce the breach rate of this service by 79% over a 2-year period. A spin-off from the Spiritum app was an program called “Quick Spiritum”. This uses robotic process automation to automate and speed up routine clinical tasks. These tasks include looking up imaging (eg chest X-rays), bloods and clinical letter and requesting tests and referrals. Quick Spiritum was found to save, on average, 30% of clinician’s time on these tasks. This work has shown what is possible with automation and digitisation, and Mark’s department is keen to tackle the next big issues. Mark and his team have been working over the last one and a half years on improving the local lung cancer pathway using the knowledge gained from the above projects. Mark has two computer science placement students working with him on this project – Joe Channing and Nick Ives. Mark’s team now have a functional “proof-of-concept” app that will be showcased at the Let’s Talk Digital Conference. This app has been created in open source and in a modular fashion. By using open source and a modular build, the hope is to be able to allow other disease sites and trusts to both benefit and collaborate on this work.\nMark is also a big advocate of advancing the clinical informatics speciality. He is a board member of the Faculty of Clinical Informatics, a board member of the NHS pycom (python community) and a current student on the NHS Digital Academy PGDip Digital Academy course. He hopes to progress this to an MSc in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull name – Marcus Baw\nJob Title(s) – Clinical Informatician, Software Developer, GP, Director at Baw Medical Ltd\nTitle of presentation – Debate: “This house believes that clinicians should be allowed to directly code and create health apps” For – Marcus Baw, Clinical Informatician, Software Developer, and other roles Against – Harold Thimbleby, Professor of Computer Science, Swansea University\nDr Marcus Baw is a practicing GP and Emergency Physician in Yorkshire, UK, with a specialist interest in health informatics and health technology.

She felt the cognitive overload of trying to remember and prioritise all patients within her care and the patient safety concerns of missed or overlooked tasks. This was coupled with the lack of transparency between tasks and staff members, with various roles working from different lists, leading to delays and inefficient ways of working. Motivated to solve these problems, Sophie was accepted onto the NHS Clinical Entrepreneur programme in 2019 with the Idea of digitising this process to improve patient safety, teamwork and workflow. Fast forward to 2023, Lister is now a developed task management solution and is currently being evaluated with 4 NHS Trusts.\nSophie’s passion for digital innovation has evolved over the years and she is a member of the National Digital Shared Decision-Making Council with NHSE, a member of the LND local council and a UCL MSc student in Digital Health. She looks forward to sharing her journey from NHS Clinician turned digital Innovator at the let’s Talk Digital Conference 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name – Mr Kareem El-Wakeel\nJob title(s) – Senior Programmer, Collaboration Digital Ltd\nTitle of presentation – An innovative way to streamline multidisciplinary team meetings, safely, efficiently, and digitally.\nAfter graduating from Bristol university with a Masters in Aeronautical Engineering, Kareem decided to pursue his passion in software development and programming.

First fix digital”\n\nHarold Thimbleby is an internationally recognised computer scientist and popular speaker who campaigns for improving digital healthcare. Harold’s book Fix IT: See and solve the problems of digital healthcare (OUP) won the British Medical Association best book awards in General Medicine; the BMA judges wrote “It is such an important book. Our ability to help patients is so reliant on IT and digital solutions. It has the broadest appeal and has achieved something quite impressive … It should be read by all healthcare staff.”\nAs an expert witness in NHS cases, Harold has helped keep healthcare professionals out of prison; he has also provided expert evidence in other cases, such as the UK Post Office scandal which prosecuted over 700 people for alleged fraud that was in fact caused by computer bugs.

He has worked in clinical trial administration and has done and still does academic teaching at the University of Oxford in ethics (mainly research ethics) and clinical trial protocol development. A self-confessed long-term computer nerd. His first computer was a ZX Spectrum 16k, which dates him somewhat. Perhaps being a computer nerd is the reason why, after a circuitous path, he has come to work in information management in a clinical department that looks after sick patients and not IT/informatics systems. He is a passionate believer in the view that the NHS should embrace and encourage frontline digital innovation where it occurs and particularly from within clinical departments. He has been fighting tooth and nail to do so and the struggle is the reason for his greying beard. Unfortunately, how the NHS and NHS Trusts do digital innovation is generally not very conducive to supporting frontline digital innovation. Consequently, he has some rather firm views on how this can be remedied…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name – Dr Mark Wardle\nJob Title(s) – Consultant Neurologist and Chief Clinical Information Officer.\nTitle of Presentation – 10 lessons from a journey through health and care data\nMark Wardle is a consultant neurologist and CCIO with a mission to build higher quality and safer healthcare services through open standards, interoperability and the use of meaningful data captured as a consequence of the processes of care.

I liked hearing about real people who took an idea and built a product or implemented a change.\nThe live feed worked really well. It was engaging and it helped me feel part of the conference despite attending virtually. Thanks to the team that made it happen.\nReally great chance to introduce myself to a new group of like-minded people, as I start out in a new direction in my career. Lively and enlightening debate session and follow-up discussion.\n\nTell us one thing you learnt or took away from the conference?\n\nThe importance of the collaborative approach to developing apps and systems, having system coders and clinical staff (and end users too) both providing their particular expertise to the task is vital for accuracy and useability, and all having a mutual respect for each other’s skills.\nThere are good ways and less good ways to innovate. The challenge is differentiating them and meetings where a frank and open discourse can occur are essential for this.\nGetting patient participation is very valuable, and can help develop the system/process."

    "title": "Why a coding course and why now?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I guess the short answer is, why not!\nThe long answer is, a little bit more complicated.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo for those of you who know me, you will know I am very passionate about digital health. I cannot really explain why. I think it is because it combines two things that I am really interested in: medicine and computers. I have been playing with computers my whole life, learned how to code in 2013 with an Arduino Uno, and I have never looked back. I got into medicine via a very convoluted route. I started in chemistry, then medicinal chemistry, and then worked in the pharmaceutical industry for a while, where I then realised I wanted to be prescribing drugs and treating patients rather than testing drugs in a lab.\nMy journey, like most, in digital health has been very\nc\no\nl\no\nu\nr\nf\nu\nl. I have built and implemented several different digital systems to automate routine, repetitive clinical tasks, and I have built systems to streamline workflows and reduce workflows. I even managed a small team of computer science students to build a prototype to help manage lung cancer treatment pathways. \n All along the way, I came across several obstacles. You are probably familiar with them:\n\nDifficulty in finding the right people to talk to.\nThe people in digital that you need to engage with have little time for “novel” ideas.\nThe people in digital actually block your “digital transformation” project.\nClinicians have no time to engage in your project.\nYou yourself have no time for the project.\nThere is no funding for the project.\nYou try and make changes at the national level, i.e., the Faculty of Clinical Informatics, and then said entity fails (yes, this happened to me!).\nAnd in some cases, you just don’t understand what is feasible with digital or how “digital” actually works.\n\nThere are of course many more!\nIt is the last bullet point that really made me realise something. A lot of clinicians I talk to, even ones that have an interest in digital healthcare, know very little about “digital” itself and how it works. It is apparent that the digital literacy across the clinical workforce is below par. How are you to understand how a “digital transformation” project is going to save you time, effort, and money, when you don’t even understand how a computer “thinks”? How can you imagine what a computer can do for you, with its ultrafast processors, if you don’t know that it thinks in yes and no questions and answers, in ones and zeros? So I started thinking, why not start building a course, a series of modules, to help my peers and anyone else interested, to better understand digital healthcare? In fact, I want to build the digital healthcare course that I would have wanted to pay money for and study when I entered this space back in 2017.\nSomeone asked me yesterday, why start with such a basic coding course, why start with the coding language Python? Why charge for the course when there are so many other programming courses out there for a fraction of the price and offer more extensive learnings? It was a good question. It is one that I have thought myself. The answer is community.\nI recently watched a YouTube video on a Dungeons and Dragons game (D&D) which has been going on for 40 years. The dungeon master said something very interesting. He said he had kept long-term relationships going by this D&D game. He said that the D&D game was the “plank” to help people meet up and keep the relationships going. This “plank” was what kept his community together. I wish to recreate the same with the Let’s Do Digital community.\nThis brings me on to another passion of mine, agile methodologies, or fail fast and learn fast. I have always thought of these concepts as trial and error, that is until reading up on other names for it. So I thought, let’s build a course for those interested in digital health, be they clinical or not, and start with solid foundations, and build on top of those. I have always learnt from first principles, and I hope others who join our courses and community do to, although I fully realise there is a breath of learning practices out there. Coding seems to be the most fundamental of digital specialties. Much like Maths is fundamental to Physics, which is fundamental to Biology which is fundamental to Psychology and so on. Having recently tutored on another coding course, it was apparent that most people in healthcare need to be shown the fundamentals of coding before they could even really grasp what a function is, a class, a web app, or even what is AI. And hence, our first course showing people the basics of coding.\nNow if this first course goes well, I envision creating further courses, building up on complexity. This would initially build up the “students” coding knowledge, but then moving on to more high-level clinical informatics topics like infrastructure, interoperability, data structures, data analysis, safety standards and so on.\nThen you may ask, why charge for such a course? Well, there are several reasons. The first is, me, and my team of tutors, are doing this all in our spare time. We have lives outside of digital health. We have families, bills to pay, and full-time jobs. I myself find time merely out of stubbornness to try and improve digital healthcare. I gave a lot of my time away for free last year, working as the Interim Chair of Council for the Faculty of Clinical Informatics. I had dropped a large portion of my paid work to enable this. My bank account was worryingly in the red for most of last summer. I feel a lot of people passionate about digital healthcare, and good digital healthcare for that matter, give a lot of their time for free to make digital happen in the NHS (and globally). I do think we should be paid for our time. And this course is more than just me running it. We have 11 tutors signed up to give their time and expertise to help you learn the fundamentals of coding. Perhaps I have pitched the ticket price too high, perhaps not. Time will tell. But, as of writing this blog, we have already had 4 people sign up for the course. I only advertised it at 10 am on Tuesday, the 9th of April on social media.\nSo, I guess what I am trying to say is this. I think we need a course to help people learn about all things digital and clinical. I think we should start it here. I am ready to take on the journey of creating such a course and its associated community. Are you ready to be involved? If so please sign up here."

    "text": "Okay, so you have some healthcare data in front of you. It might make sense, it might not. How do you figure out what it means? How do you find out how it was entered, is it accurate or even what was the person thinking should be entered?\nWe will get to that!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been a firm believer in education for some time. I used to supervise pharmacy students when I was doing my degree in Medicinal Chemistry, and I was a tutor for final year medical students when I was a foundation doctor. I have provided education to junior doctors, and, until recently, I was an FCI mentor for Dr Anita Phung (sadly the FCI is no more). I have also wanted to study, and subsequently teach, digital health, coding, and clinical informatics in general. On top of this, I have been a perpetual student, having just completed the NHS Digital Academy - Digital Leadership course.\nAt the recent Digital Health ReWired conference in Birmingham, I asked a question at one of the talks about AnalystX. The question went something like this:\n\nWe have lots of courses in data analytics, clinical informatics, etc., but how come we do not have any courses on teaching computer scientists, data analysts, cyber security experts, etc., about clinical?\n\nThis question was well received by the panel, and, it later turned out, the audience as well. However, the answer seemed to be, “we just don’t have that in place.”\nStraight away after the talk, a data analyst came up to me and said, “yes, we need such a course.” We had a long and fruitful discussion about it, and so I decided to talk to a few people I knew were at the conference and might be able to help / endorse a course for “digital folk.”\nAfter a bit of wandering around the conference venue, I found James Freed, Deputy Director of the NHS Digital Academy, someone who I know well and who was happy to help with the course. I also spoke to Alex Cheung from AnalystX who was also very supportive.\nSo there I was, with a big idea about teaching clinical matters to non-clinicians. I started to think about which disease I should teach first, should I talk about anatomy, should I talk about “what is health” and “what is disease”? I eventually thought it was best to ask those that were likely to want to sit in on this webinar series. So I asked the NHS-R and NHS PyCom folk, people I know well, via their respective Slack channels. These are the topics I got back:\n\nHow to best display data/results of analysis.\nHow would we identifying datasets, like pneumonia on X-rays, or ROCT eye scans would be helpful for coders who want to explore the application of deep learning to medical data.\nItems like sourcing the data, the issues with medical data, how to deal with paucity, etc.\nStructured data input vs. free text. How to reach busy clinicians and close the loop to reduce the quantity of free text, and increase use of structured data?\nHow to communicate that data quality starts at the data input stage - what messaging would be most effective at reaching clinicians?\nNEWS2, PEWS, MEWS, MEOWS. What are they, how are they different, which are new and which might soon be replaced? Can their data be useful analytically and clinically after the patient has been discharged?\nClinical coding from a clinician’s perspective. How is this best tought to clinicians? What rules do clinicians apply to help ensure that notes are accurately coded (ie. services receive appropriate ICD10 and OPCS4 codes, so that accurate HRG and TFC codes can be grouped), earning the service tariff (or block) income?\nHow could we do better together?\nWhat, from a clinician’s perspective, are the top 3-5 missed opportunities relating to analytical use of data, that would most significantly improve the situation for you, your patients, or the NHS generally?\nClinical data entry - overview of environments for data entry - e.g. in my head I imagine a trolley on a ward where patient notes are updated - what are the real-life data entry points, when does this information get “clinically coded”, how often is it checked, when does it get rolled up into an e.g. SUS submission or when does it hit EMIS/TPP data centres?\nUsability - what is the status quo of e.g. EPRs - some talk of waiting 15 minutes to login etc. How much of best practice UX (e.g. from consumer land) make it’s way into clinical software systems?\nWhen is a dashboard useful vs superfluous? A lot of data analysis applications seem to culminate in dashboards - what are some good/bad examples of clinical dashboards?\nDecision support tools and software as a medical device - aware of warnings like “this information is for guidance only and not intended to replace a diagnosis from a trained clinician” are used to avoid needing to get through SaMD regs - in reality, how reliant are clinical teams on unregulated software products?\nKnown pitfalls for machine learning on medical data might be useful.\nI would be interested in learning a bit more about popular acronyms (and what they mean). Also a bit about their day-to-day from the operational side of things.\n\nWell done if you read all of them.\nAs you can see, there is a wide range of topics, however, not really the stuff I learned about at medical school. The above bullet points are more practical questions rather than academic; stuff that you learn and interact with by just being a doctor and doing the day job. So I had a rethink. I decided to start with something I know well, and would be a good place to start a new series. So instead of “here is Prof Mark, telling you about how many times the airways divide in your lungs” (24 by the way), the series is now named “Ask a Clinician” and the first episode will be about “Insights from a medic”.\nFuture episodes (I am hoping for one a month, but don’t hold me to that as I do this in my “spare” time) will bring in GPs, surgeons, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and more. I already have a few episodes lined up if this first one goes well.\nAnd so, if you are interested, please do join us at the first of many episodes of “Ask a Clinician” by signing up here."

After a few hours of research, I was trying to find an analogue in the real physical world that minors Kubernetes. I thought large DIY stores seem to fit the bill. Then I thought I would ask ChatGPT what it thought of this concept. It seemed to be right on the mark.\nQuestion\nExplain kubernetes but in the form of a large diy store franchise\nResult\nSure, I can try to explain Kubernetes using a large DIY store franchise as an analogy!\nImagine that you are the owner of a large DIY store franchise. Your business is booming and you have a lot of customers coming in every day, each with their own unique projects and needs. You want to make sure that you have enough inventory, staff, and resources to keep up with demand, while also making sure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently.\nEnter Kubernetes.\nKubernetes is like your store’s management system. It helps you manage all the different parts of your business – from inventory and staffing to customer service and marketing. It’s like having a team of expert managers who can keep everything running smoothly and handle any issues that arise.\nIn Kubernetes, you have “nodes” that are like the physical locations of your stores. These nodes can be in different regions, just like your stores can be in different cities or countries. Each node has its own set of resources, just like each store has its own inventory and staff.\nThen you have “pods,” which are like the different departments in your stores. For example, you might have a plumbing department, an electrical department, and a garden center. Each pod has a specific function and set of resources, just like each department has its own inventory and staff.\nKubernetes helps you manage all these different pods and nodes, making sure that they are all working together efficiently. If one pod is getting overwhelmed with customers, Kubernetes can automatically shift resources to that pod to help it handle the load. If a node goes down, Kubernetes can redirect traffic to another node to make sure that customers can still access your store.\nOverall, Kubernetes is like the ultimate DIY store management tool. It helps you keep everything organized, efficient, and running smoothly, even as your business grows and changes over time."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\nBailey Medics Ltd, under the trade name Let’s Do Digital, aims to bridge the knowledge gap in health informatics by creating an accessible, continuously updated online guide. The healthcare sector’s increasing reliance on informatics necessitates a reliable and current resource for professionals and enthusiasts alike. By adopting an Education as a Service approach, Bailey Medics Ltd aims to offer flexible, up-to-date and accessible learning opportunities that keep pace with advancements in health informatics.\n\n\nObjectives\n\nTo create and maintain a comprehensive and free to access online guide on health informatics.\nTo conduct a series of webinars as a revenue stream and educational initiative.\nTo engage with 2-5 external sponsors as an additional revenue stream.\nTo ensure the guide remains current through regular reviews and updates.\nTo expand the webinar series if the initial 10 webinars are successful.\nTo later develop a paid for exam covering the topic of health informatics.\n\n\n\nScope\nThe project encompasses the development of the guide, organisation and delivery of webinars, securing sponsorship, and engaging subject matter experts for content creation and examination questions.\n\n\nFeedback\nFeedback from social engagements has been very positive. A post by Mark Bailey (of Bailey Medics Ltd) on LinkedIn about the guide (initially referred to as the “Handbook of Clinical Informatics”) had many positive comments and large numbers of engagements. As of the 30th of July, this post regarding the guide had 4771 impressions, 2520 unique views, and 36 comments. The top reaction was from Clinical Scientists and the top comments were from Medical Doctors. The post can be viewed here."

We had some amazing feedback from module 1, but a few students mentioned it would be great to have a more basic level module in programming. Hence, we have created module 0.\nModule 0 is open to anyone, but has been designed for those working or interested in digital healthcare / clinical informatics. Module 0 is designed for those with no prior knowledge in coding. We will gently take you through what the command line is, how to run a command and how to program the basics. The programming language we will be using is Python. Python is a well-respected programming language that is very versatile. You can build simple programs at one end and run data analysis, machine learning/AI, and build extensive web apps at the other."

    "text": "Where to start?\n\n\n\n\n\nSo a number of you have heard me talk about the Handbook of Clinical informatics for a while now, either on Discourse or LinkedIn (eg this post). It is a learning resource I wish I had when I started out in Clinical Informatics in 2017. There has been a lot of interest in the handbook idea, and I have been working on the best way to deliver it for anyone interested in using it (myself included). I have had a lot of discussions about how to create the handbook. Here are my thoughts so far…\nFirst of all, to be more inclusive, and also to get away from the notion of this being only a printed resource, we have renamed the resource to Essentials of Health Informatics, and we will be using the term guide rather than “handbook”.\nI would love to be able to create this guide for free, but it is very difficult to get busy clinicians and digital folk to do things that are not paid around their busy working weeks (myself included). I have worked on the idea for a while, and I was thinking of the below delivery plan.\nWe would offer 10 paid for webinars to start with (later expanding on this), with the material from these webinars being used to create chapters in the handbook (which will be online and open source) and also exam questions. Dr Trefor Roscoe has kindly offered his services to chair these webinars. He has many years of experience of teaching clinical informatics.\nI would love to hear what topics people think should be covered in the first 10 webinars. Please select up to 10 topics you would like to see in these first webinars and hit submit."

    "section": "Digital transformation is the game",
    "text": "Digital transformation is the game\nI’ve just about worked in the NHS long enough to remember the days when a bit of money occasionally appeared for digital transformation. You remember the thrill of hearing someone had some cash in their budget for something digital I’m sure - it’s like Christmas morning and you’ve found the biggest present under the tree has your name on it. I recall attending project boards in CCG offices with clinicians redesigning pathways, excited to fix a problem, “this could spread across the STP!”. I’ve sat in MDTs, where people were elated to hear there was tech out there to improve their ways of working and they couldn’t wait to embrace something new. I loved pilots, everything about them – from the earnest suppliers keen to develop their products into an optimal solution, to the host sites eager to see what benefit a new gadget or software could bring. And the evaluations! I was fascinated to see the impact something digital could have and was immensely proud to be a part of clinical and workforce transformation.\nFinancial constraints have always existed – half of one of my residentials for the Digital Health Leadership Programme was dedicated to roleplaying, asking an Executive Board for money (sounds tame but was genuinely one of the most intense activities I’ve ever been a part of, we scoffed when Cohort One warned us about it but there were plenty of helpings of humble pie that day, let me tell you). One unintended benefit of this limitation, in my opinion, is giving us the opportunity to do some creative problem-solving. But peril lies in wait just around the corner, friend – there are time constraints as well, and human resource ones – let’s throw in some tricky stakeholder engagement to the mix as well. Now it’s getting interesting.\nMy ICB had adopted SharePoint as part of another project, and I was nothing short of astounded at what my teammates had managed to achieve. This wasn’t your back of Teams document library, oh no. This was a living, breathing intranet site which, not long after its launch, teams across the ICB adopted at pace. They designed their own pages, added their own content, asked for more pages, tiptoed with curiosity into the art of the possible and pretty soon didn’t really need the Digital Delivery team’s help at all – the dream of BAU realised. Bliss!\nSome Practices had their own SharePoint sites set up for them as well, which was admittedly a tad more clunky – perhaps as you might expect given how we were trying to recreate another solution. There was a lot of engagement, a lot of co-design and a lot of moments of despair, partially because the version of SharePoint we use in the NHS environment isn’t the all singing, all dancing SharePoint you read about on the Microsoft support forums rendering the guidance utterly redundant and throwing you out in the cold, but believe me my team wrangled with it tirelessly until it was as fit for purpose as could be. Now I’d had next to nothing to do with this project initially, but I eventually barge in with a problem to solve and some sparky ideas on how to solve it."

Oodles of really helpful documents. My understanding was that this was used predominantly in general practice, and a bit of secondary care, but by and large a historic tool developed by the CCG.\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it: the contract is going to run out, there’s absolutely no money to replace it but everyone wants to keep it."

It was the first project I was assigned to manage at the ICB and I was excited to conduct some user research in the early Spring, cobble together a request for information from suppliers and present findings back to stakeholders to take things from there.\nLovely stuff, what could go wrong? I’ll tell you what, and I cannot emphasise these words enough: nearly everything!\nFrom low user engagement because of devastating timing with OPEL Four status to not being able to determine product ownership to not one single penny being available for procurement, this project had it all. The requirements weren’t anything astronomically complicated, but it didn’t matter – there was no money to do anything. Members of different teams tried to figure it out. Leads of directorates tried to figure it out. Risks were added to the organisation risk register, papers were written for the Executive team. Meetings were held with current suppliers, people who used different suppliers, new requirements arose, new stakeholders appeared, the scope crept and expanded and exploded. Domains expired, complexities arose, presentations to Boards were made, everything I could think of doing, I did – but inevitably I was met with dead end after dead end. It was miserable.\nTime was ticking and I was no closer to solving the problem than I was on day one. With the contract set to expire, I made a decision – recreating the website in SharePoint, though not perfect, was going to be better than having nothing at all. So I got to work."

I wrote out my vision, I included timelines, the scope of my plan, the limitations and the benefits, the risks, you name it I did it. I blew the metaphorical doors off the hinges going into those meetings and, slightly agog, everyone gave me a thumbs up to proceed."

    "section": "Let’s have a look",
    "text": "Let’s have a look\nThe fun part commenced immediately – designing the actual SharePoint site. I needed it to be a near identical match to the existing homepage of the website because I wanted it to be instantly recognisable. If you’d used the website before, you’d have no problem navigating the SharePoint site. Fortunately, this was the easiest part of the whole thing. Take a look:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, some exploration was required in understanding the tricks of a document library within a SharePoint site. This again wasn’t too difficult in terms of the design, as the existing website worked in a similar way making use of tags. Well wouldn’t you know it, you can create columns and tags in SharePoint too. Another win!\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd\n\n\n\n\n\nThe document library works a lot like an Excel sheet – you can sort and filter, so the more tags you have, the better the search results. And those search results generate their own URL, so that’s what all the hyperlinks on the homepage take you to. Simple when you know the answer isn’t it! That took me a good couple of days to get the hang of, bloody thing.\nI figured out very early on in the migration process that it wasn’t going to be as easy as downloading the files from the existing website and uploading them into the SharePoint. The file names needed some tweaks to them so they were coherent and tags needed to be first created in the SharePoint, then assigned to the corresponding file. There were two ways to do this: badly, or correctly. Through gritted teeth, I set about creating 305 different filtered views to correspond with the pages of the website, migrated 2053 files of which nearly all of them needed something fixed and added to these files 7813 tags. The SharePoint site now worked in exactly the same way as the website.\nLots of other bumps in the road ensued and it took a lot of grit and determination to work through the issues, one by one. These ranged from figuring out guest access into the NHS tenant for approved non-NHS.net users to nearly losing my mind when a straightforward URL redirect didn’t work and resulted in setting up a new server (thank goodness I work with some very clever people who know how to do things like that). Some are still outstanding because they’re bigger challenges that I either can’t do anything about, or I can’t do by myself. Reasonable, you might think, but I’m incredibly hard on myself about this. I feel terrible that people have to wait to get access to documents, or links on other sites don’t take them straight to the file they’re looking for (though I’ve mapped hundreds of them with the help of some code I taught myself, the time-consuming part is updating them). It’s relentless and has often felt like there was no light at the end of the tunnel. I joined the NHS so I could help develop and improve things through technology, and here I was doing the opposite of that. Not enabling, not problem solving, but testing absolutely everyone’s patience."

    "text": "Feedback\nI said that “testing absolutely everyone’s patience” statement one day to my Deputy CIO, who I consider a knowledgeable and compassionate leader who doesn’t deserve the high blood pressure I cause him. “What are you talking about??” he asked me, exasperated. “If it wasn’t for you, this entire thing wouldn’t even exist!” And that, miraculously, reached a part of my mind I’d thrown asunder while caught up in the whirlwind of Sorting The Thing Out and Getting The Thing Done. For all the annoyances of what I’d done, I’d also brought something really valuable into being, and worked my socks off to win hearts and minds along the way. I don’t like to toot my own trumpet so here’s some feedback from some very kind people.\n\n“I have had positive feedback from your meetings” – Deputy Director\n“I know how much work you’ve been putting into this” – Senior Transformation Manager\n“I know this SharePoint has been a huge nightmare but we are really grateful for what you have been doing to try to sort things out for everyone” – Lead Pharmacist\n“Incredibly useful for my daily practice” – GP Medical Officer, RAF\n“I can only imagine the incredibly HUGE task of what you’re doing! Thanks so much for all your help, really appreciate it” – GP Pharmacy technician\n“Regardless of the issues, I think you should be proud of yourself for creating such a great repository” – Specialist Registrar\n\n\nSo what difference does it make, when one person working in digital health sets their mind to doing something? What impact can an individual have?\n\nI eventually stopped diminishing this project. “It’s only a SharePoint page” I’d say, even when it was never really just that. It was a huge undertaking to ensure that clinicians had the right documents at the right time to support patient care. It was long days for months on end to help open the resource up beyond general practice, beyond community and secondary care, beyond even the footprint of my ICB. It was an opportunity for me to learn and grow and come up with innovative ways of doing things that no one has done before.\nCertainly, that is better than nothing."

This had a great turn out, show casing of exciting digital innovation in the South West and great discussion. Once of the topics that arose from both the Quarterly meeting and the digital Summer School that I joined over that week is the issue of digital innovation happening in silos and people not hearing about what is going on around the country, how they can collaborate and how they can benefit from the works from others. Hence, during the quarterly meeting I raised the idea about a means to share these digital innovations with others. This would also be a place for people to submit their ideas and for a team of software engineers (hopefully hired directly within the NHS) to build and then also share their learnings and digital solutions. In some ways this is a new digital movement of frontline staff sharing far and wide, paying forwards their homegrown digital solutions, which will benefit all within the NHS. I am formulating the idea of a sharing platform."

    "text": "Brighton, 2007\nStill somewhat fresh from an eight-year stint as CTO in a local games company, I was working as a contractor, handling 2nd line desktop support for the Trust I am still employed in today. It was to be a stopgap, something to keep a roof over my head while scoping out where to go next. I hoped at the time to jump into another startup, there were and still are many to choose from in the city I work in and the contacts I’d cultivated in those eight years were telling me of all sorts of possibilities I could go for, some local, others further afield. The day job in the datacentre was a depressing place to be, there was a lot of animus directed at the IT department from all quarters in the Trust and despite all the money spent on NPfIT, ‘they’ (and it was very much a ‘they and us’ kind of mentality) were getting impatient at the ongoing lack of progress. Much of the work we did could be handled remotely, however I generally preferred to get out of my chair and go fix the problem in-person. Often as not the problem had been poorly described in the ticket and some important nuance of the issue had been overlooked, this was my justification for doing this, I also got to meet a lot of cool clinicians at work. While poking around at the problem, the clinician hovering over my shoulder waiting for me to finish, would unburden themselves of all the IT woes they were experiencing. Some of these issues I could happily just fix, there and then (grr, printers!) but most of what I heard was beyond my scope. These complaints were often phrased as ‘Why can’t (system/technology/device) X do Y. or Why do I have to have eleven applications open to run a clinic? Or, most heartbreakingly, if only this (system/technology/device) did X, we could achieve this ‘really-amazing-new-thing’ and save hours or create better outcomes for patients or make an important part of that service work smoothly. If it had been just one or two of these instances, I might have been fine finishing up my contract, turning back to the games industry and finding a new company to help build and succeed. It was instead, depressingly frequent. A few of these clinicians, took the time to educate me on how the NHS did things and how disjointed and frankly half-arsed some of the multi-million pound programmes appeared to be. Coming from where I did, it horrified me; professionally, as a user of the NHS and as a taxpayer.Reader, I got angry. I continued (carefully and cautiously) asking questions and looking for myself, the picture never improved, I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, I must be missing something right? No. Part of me wanted to shout and scream, but that would have been counterproductive. Anyway, I’ve always been the type to try and fix things, so I stayed. And I promised myself I wouldn’t leave until it was fixed. I still carry that anger mostly it just simmers now."

    "text": "London, 1989\nI got my first proper IT job at the end of the eighties. I was really lucky and didn’t yet know it; I worked for Reuters. We were the best paid, best trained and even better, best led IT workers in the city. Reuters had caught the wave when the City was deregulated post-big bang and by the time I joined they were the biggest game in town for financial data and market news. They spent billions (1990’s billions at that) on the infrastructure to deliver their products, I joined a team of over 400 shift workers, all employed keeping the golden geese happy and delivering eggs. We had a mantra, drilled into us pretty much from the outset. It leant on Reuters’ journalistic roots: - First, be accurate. If we published data, it absolutely had to be correct, 100%. Second, be timely. When we published data, it had to be actionable and immediate; microseconds count. Third, be reliable, day on day, week after week. We had to deliver the above, consistently.\nThere were (and presumably still are) all manner of technologies deployed to deliver on this mantra. Some, simple and robust. Others, exotic and bleeding edge. I can’t detail any of these here (Still under NDA!) but I can talk to how the human processes and procedures we developed and deployed to deliver on this, worked. (Sometimes called the 8th layer in the OSI stack, or more crudely, the meat layer) Kaizen, Lean, Six Sigma, ISO9001. Anything that could give us an edge was eagerly consumed and deployed. The business we were in was and still is ruthlessly Darwinian, we were constantly chasing marginal gains, adding extra 9’s to the sigma (Six Sigma was in our view, a bit lightweight; we managed seven and eight sigma for many of our systems routinely)Despite the very formal team structures we had, with crystal-clear operational responsibilities and authority to act (we had a lot of ex-Royal Navy types who worked there) there was also a complementary flat structure when it came to how these marginal gains were identified and deployed. Simply put, if you found the problem, it was yours to fix. No passing it up the line or handing it off. You did it. It didn’t matter if it was a mess someone else had made or if it was outside of your normal responsibilities. You did it or made sure it got done. It was a heady place to work, it has spoiled me for working anywhere else since. It wasn’t perfect by any means, but for the time, it was bloody close. It’s one of the sources of my ongoing anger. I want to be chasing the same marginal gains in the NHS, I want us to be chasing down that next 9 rather than lurching all over, as we contend with God knows how many years of legacy systems, uncommunicative silos, balkanised organisations, and the all too frequent ‘not invented here’ attitude I’ve heard more than I care to recall."

    "text": "Brighton, 1999\n‘Why isn’t the queue running out the door?’ I said to the recruiter. I was at a job fair standing at a desk where the job advertised was as a game tester. I handed my freshly printed CV, full of Reuters’ earned IT certifications that ran to a whole page at this point. Totally unsuited to the role I was applying for. There was, however, a small section at the end in ‘interests’, that hinted at my PC and console gaming obsession. ‘Someone will call you later, we’re well busy’ the recruiter replied. I’d left the City after rather a horrible year. 1998 was my personal annus horribilis. I won’t detail here, but I was still in a rough place, a year later. I’d escaped to Brighton to join my brother and spent the following summer partying and forgetting. The money was running out though. A job was needed and I was bracing myself to join one of the regional bank offices or worse, American Express. I was spared this fate. Someone did indeed call. I had a job testing games, 48 hours later.\n‘Can you ask them if they’ve actually read my CV?’ this was to the QA lead. Four glorious months of late nights, pizza deliveries and sweaty geeks, playing and testing games. (Dungeon Keeper 2, if you’re interested.) I’d just heard one of the directors walking past, bemoaning the fact that they’d lost the third person who’d been hired as IT manager, on their first day. He didn’t quite run away screaming, but he did walk rather quickly. Ten minutes later, they’d read my CV and I was hired on the spot as the fifth full-time employee of Babelmedia. I was back in the saddle. Well, sort of. They couldn’t afford an actual saddle. The company had been founded about nine months prior, an offshoot of a game development studio. They’d launched a game that was actually pretty good, but it had failed on launch due to some pretty dire QA issues. It got panned in the games press and disappeared from sight, shortly after. Smarting from this, a new venture was run past the CEO; to create a company that got QA right. Especially where language QA was concerned (they call it localisation testing). Some favours were called in from around the industry and they raided the local universities for European native linguists and games players. Babelmedia started in a converted flat on Western road and in the first five months it went gangbusters. The fancy new office behind Hove station a few months later was their first expansion and the expansion never really stopped. We doubled the size of the business every six months for the following six years. Keeping up with this kind of expansion, from an IT infrastructure and services perspective is a tall ask. Part of me still wonders whether I should have run screaming too. With a budget and resources allocation that can charitably be compared to a couple of used Marmite pots, a ball of second-hand string and a bag of stale Murray mints, I barely kept ahead. The demands required that I pivot from my corporate thinking to one of extreme creativity, I didn’t sleep a lot for the first two years, but I really didn’t care. I was having too much fun.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn those six years we grew to a company that operated in three continents. We had major offices in Brighton (Hove, actually), Delhi and Montreal. A recording studio in London, sales offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo and several thousand employees, when all the translators and freelancers were counted in. We were one of the major players in the games-services sector, our client list read like a who’s who of the major games industry companies. We even got a feature written about us in Edge magazine, a singular honour. One of our biggest coups was being hired to create the first app certification platforms for mobile phone games. This was before iPhone, so it was mostly Nokia phones. We designed the certification process for both Vodafone and Sun Microsystems (the makers of Java). Certification of software is a process that is most often used in closed software platforms. The certification processes that we were used to prior to this, were those used by the major console players; Nintendo, Sony PlayStation and Microsoft XBOX. It works like this. Let’s use Sony as an example. You’re a development studio and you want to develop a game for PlayStation. OK, Sony will sell you a licence (after some due diligence) to develop a game, they’ll issue you with a Software Development Kit (SDK) and you also get to buy some special PlayStations designed for developing games and probably a few of the PlayStations designed for testing them. Part of the SDK is a phone-book sized document called the TRC (Technical Requirements Checklist)The TRC is your bible, therein you will find all of the do’s and don’ts of how your game shall work. You want to use a particular UI element? there are rules for that. You need to make a particular kind of call to the graphics engine in the console? Rules for that too. You get the idea. When you’re done developing (probably a few years later) you tell Sony, ‘Hey we’re done!’ Can we release the game already? They will book your game into a slot, for compliance testing. This is often done well in advance; you don’t want to miss the holiday season rush. They will take your finely honed and hopefully well-made game and during that booked slot, put it through a series of exacting tests, to make sure you really did follow the rules in the TRC. If you did, then yay! The game is released for mastering and disc duplication and hopefully, on the shelves in time for Christmas. If you fail compliance testing, however. Oh, my. Well, the next available slot is in six months. Too bad. We hope you do better next time. What do you mean, the marketing is already done? Sorry, can’t help you there. Sounds horrifying, yes? I’ve seen it happen. Grown men crying, the whole shebang. What does this have to do with the NHS I hear you ask? What’s all this games industry waffle for, and why would we want to have such an objectionable process for our software? It’s bad enough as it is! I’m getting to that. And yes. I really do think we need such a process in the NHS."

    "text": "Brighton, 2024\nQA is such an important thing in the games industry, delivering a finished, polished and compelling product that will sell, calls for the highest possible standards in software development. Every element of the game is gone over thousands of times, every possible player nutation is agonised over, the user experience honed to a fine edge, with hundreds of expert eyes looking not only for errors, but also ways to improve and optimise it. Imagine the kinds of amazing healthcare and clinical applications we’d have in the NHS if the software we acquired, had some form of minimum set of standards applied to application design, UX and usability.\nThis is the rest of the reason I’m still angry. I’ve seen how good software is developed and deployed in other industries and it’s not like there isn’t the talent for it out there. Standards are needed, good ones too. The process above is a worst case scenario, I’m not saying that we copy the Sony example slavishly, but a certification process and compliance testing for NHS applications that told developers, these are what you have to do. Nothing less will suffice; it won’t get in if you don’t. If we did this, I might think my work here is done, and calm down a bit. Where to begin though. It’s fine having standards but if no-one pays much mind to them, then why bother? I don’t have all or even any of the answers, necessarily. I’m here to learn. I’d like to contribute to the ongoing discussion about what we should be doing. What does good look like? How do we define and refine our standards for the clinical informatics we commission, develop and use. I do strongly believe that we need a set of common, enforced standards for these systems and perhaps, one day even better; common systems and platforms in use across our whole service."

It has affected systems in the NHS too, with my local hospital having 4 major systems affected by the update (confirmed by frontline staff). There are many sites talking through how to fix the issue caused by the update, and one can be found here. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity technology company based in Austin, Texas. It is concerning that a company that is supposed to keep the our Windows computers safe, has caused planes, banks and even your favourite supermarket to suffer.\nThe above global news story has given me the push to write about a topic that I have been wanting to talk about for some time. It is time to talk about pyramids.\n Digital Health Infrastructure Pyramid\nThe above pyramid is a concept I recently discussed at the Swedish SFMI conference in October 2023. It was a very well received concept. I have been meaning to discuss it here in the UK, and so here we go.\nYou may notice a lot of talk at the top level of government (well at least the recent previous one) is (was) about how AI can fix pretty much all of your clinical problems. Unfortunately, there is a lot of Snake Oil around all of this. This is not to say AI cannot help you with your clinical or admin problem, but you need to choose wisely. And even if the AI solution that you are trying to install could deliver better digital care, there is a huge overlooked problem that seems to be rarely talked about at the centre downwards. This elephant in the room is that we are not getting the basics right. We are asking AI to help run our practices, but they cannot connect to the right resources. We are asking AI to analyse data and diagnose some serious disease or help manage a patient’s condition, but the data in our digital systems are poorly entered and poorly managed. We need to enable, correctly and safety, and implement the basics before we consider anything as advanced as AI enabled healthcare.\nSo what is the Digital Health Infrastructure Pyramid? It is a principle that you need to get the basics right first, and only progress to the next level of digital transformation when you have secured the current level of infrastructure. You need to build strong foundations before you can build on top of your base. If you have not secured your foundations, it is very likely the top of your pyramid will topple over, the inverted pyramid philosophy.\nSo what does each level of the pyramid mean, and what do you need to sign off before you can start building on the next level up? Let’s take it in order.\n\nStaff resources: At this very basic, but essential, stage, you need a workforce that can work well and safely. For this you need the right resources for ALL staff including food, water, rest areas, equipment and working environments.\nClinical competency: For a healthcare system to enable great and safe care for their patients, you need well trained clinical and non-clinical staff AND of appropriate numbers.\nDigital basics: Once you have got your staff working at the best of their abilities in a safe and well trained system, you can then move onto digital. In this stage, you need to focus on the basic IT infrastructure. This includes a well trained and in appropriate numbers IT workforce, networks, intranet connectivity, computers and printers.\nStable and fast infrastructure: This is where you up your game. At this stage you look to fully optimise the basic digital systems that you have running in your infrastructure. This includes fast running and stable computers and fast running and stable internet.\nStandardised interoperability: This may seem a bit odd to put next as an essential foundation before moving up the pyramid, especially before having any EPR (electronic patient record) or related healthcare specific digital system. However, I feel it is very important to think about this, agree on this, and then build around the interoperability standard when you build our healthcare specific digital systems. Ideally this should be a national interoperability standard.\nHealth Informatic systems: Now you have a secure, stable and working system. You have staff that are providing the best care that they can deliver, and IT systems that are ready for you to build your digital health systems onto. It is now that you can start installing your EPR, your image system (PACS) your bloods and microbiology system (LIMS). This can be a very difficult stage. Which EPR should you buy, should you make it in house, how do you train and prepare your staff for this new way of working, how to you enable rather than hinder by using digital?\nAI clinical decision: At this stage, you should have good quality data, health information systems that work well and are helping your staff provide great care for their patients. You can now consider using AI to help the clinical team (and likely the non-clinical team too) to help provide support for patient management through the use of clinical decision support systems (CDSS). And you need to hone in great end-user centred design so that these systems actually enable rather than hinder. There is a huge issues with CDSSs and how they alert too much or inappropriately. This is appropriately named alert fatigue.\nAI automated: The Topol review states that healthcare can greatly advance by using AI (and genomics). There is great possibilities to improve workloads, workflows and patient safety with the use of AI. However, we need to do this with our eyes wide open. AI is not perfect. AI can cause harm. AI can hinder and prolong processes, just like any other “transformation” project. But at the end of the day, for AI to even potentially deliver benefits to healthcare, we need the strong and secure footings of all of the stages below it.\n\nNow, this pyramid is not set in stone (excuse the pun). This Digital Health Infrastructure Pyramid is my view on how we should have solid foundation before we more onto the next stage of digital. I would love to hear other’s thoughts on this pyramid, how it is right, how it is wrong, and how it can be improved. Leave a comment or email me at mark@letsdodigital.org"

    "text": "There is so much information out there on the web about “digital health”, but its feels like we currently lack the educational wisdom that we need in clinical informatics!\n\n\n\n\n\nI am curious about something and would greatly appreciate feedback from anyone that is happy to give it, no matter how “out there” it may be.\nFor a few year’s now, I have wanted to have and use the “Oxford Handbook of Clinicial Informatics”. This does not exists of course, but I have benefited tremendously from other Oxford Handbooks. They are concise, well planned out, accurate and get you the facts that you need fast for the speciality you are currently doing. Pretty much my whole med school year’s was focused on leaning the pages of the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine. I was addicted to the Respiratory one whilst progressing in Respiratory Medicine. I still look at it from time to time.\nSo I would like to write this handbook that I am so critically missing. I would like to the write the Clincial Informatics Handbook. This would not however be an Oxford hard copy handbook, but an online, open source version of it, that anyone could use for free. The only issue with this is how do I pay for my time to write this “Let’s Do Digital Handbook of Clincial Informatics”?\nI have been wondering if I could build the handbook in stages. I could prepare and give webinars of different topics, and for each topic, place the materials into the ever expanding Handbook. Each webinar would ask the attendees for a nominal fee (something like £4-9).\nSo here is my question, would you pay to come to these webinars. Would you be interested in attending? We would need a fair number of people to attend for this to be worth while.\nLet me know what you think."

    "section": "Let’s Talk About Careers in Clinical Informatics and White Swans",
    "text": "Let’s Talk About Careers in Clinical Informatics and White Swans\nSo I am not one to write blogs about my thoughts, mainly just updates on meetings I am hosting. Today things are different! Let’s talk about careers and swans.\nAs many of you may know, I am a council member of the Faculty of Clinical Informatics (FCI). A fair number of you will know that we had our member’s conference on the 1st of December in London. This was a fantastic meeeting, with lots of great talks about the new FCI strategy, great projects happening across the UK and also a great session about good digital innovation (something close to my heart). It was lovely to meet up with friends and colleagues, and plan for the future ahead.\nNow, the low point for me at the member’s conference was the fact that the closing drinks reception were sponsored by a company named Palantir. I do not want to distract from the title of this blog, but let’s just say that I was not best impressed by the FCI’s decision (which I was not party to) to accept monies from said company. The only reason that I bring it up is that 9 of the conference members (me included) decided that we did not want to put drinks to lips sponsored by a company with a shady history. So what did we do, we had a splinter off party down the local pub, the White Swan.\nNow this is where the story got interesting. So a number of us got talking about the conference, the sponsored drinks and then after a few more pints, career opportunies for junior doctors (I happened to be sitting with doctors). This is where it struck me; the conversations I was having with 3 of the 9 splinter-group-go-pub members reminded me that I was exactly in their position just 12 months ago! 12 months ago I started looking for a new job in digital innovation after getting very little traction with the digital team in my current role. I am not talking about a new role in the more political positions in the NHS, which I feel a lot of people aspire to (rightly or wrongly), but I mean clinicians-who-code positions!\nI’ll come back to the clinicians-who-code remark.\nWhat I realised when I spoke to Anita Phung, Michael Kriger and Alistair Cannon down the White Swan is that it is hard being a passionate, detail-focused clinician that both deeply understands the clinical aspects of a digital build but also has in depth knowledge of how digital really works, how you can programmatically code it, what it can and cannot do and just make things better for frontline staff. The latter remark is what drives me to make digital healthcare great! It is something that I have done now for the last 3 years with different apps I have build for my current respiratory department and it is something I want to continue doing. I am lucky! I have just been offered a job in industry with the forward thinking Sleepstation / Born Digital Health company. I previously referred insomnia patients to them, and now I will be helping them with my knowledge of sleep medicine and digital medicine. However, many junior clinicians do not get this kind of break!\nNow, let’s talk about clinicians-who-code. There is no exact definition for this, and I have had many conversation about improving on the name. What I have settled for is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinician-who-codes\n\n\n\nSomeone that understands, in deepth, the clinical area being studied and the coding language that is needed to provide great digital innovation to said clinical area. One does not need a formal clinical qualification to satisfy the “clinical” part of this name.\n\n\nSo you don’t need to be a doctor, nurse, pharmacist, midwife, etc, etc to be a clinician-who-codes, just someone that has learnt about the clinical area that needs digital improvement and then can apply said improvement using their digital knowledge (from a code upwards approach). My friend and colleague Grant Vallance nicely fits this bill.\nSo anyone can be a clinician-who-codes really, it is just about mindset and learning. I would argue (but of course I would as I am one) that we needs 100s, if not 1000s of clinicians-who-code in the NHS to tackle bad digital implementations, break them down, rebuild them and build anew. We need digital systems that improve patient management, experience and outcomes. We need systems that reduce the workloads and improve the workflows of our fellow staff. There are too many digital systems used across the NHS that just are not fit for purpose. Let’s build from the ground up. Let’s get our junior doctors, nurses, pharmacists, midwives, etc, and those inspiring coders that just want to make things better into postions to do just that, make things better. We need to start having these conversations about how to do things better. We need to have career paths for our junior clinical informaticians that are not just aimed at high level managerial NHS digital roles. We need to use the passion that is so evident in these young people, provide them with jobs and just allow them to improve things for everyone. The ways we have been doing things so far in the NHS has had very variable results. It is time to let the new blood show us the way, we just need to give them the career paths to do so!"

It was back then that I started building different apps to speed up mine and colleagues clinical and admin workflows. I even got some robotic process automation in there.\nI would have given my left arm to study a Clinician-who-code course. Today, I am left with the feeling that a CWC course still needs to exist. I fully appreciate that no everyone needs to have in depth knowledge of both clinical and digital (aka coding) aspects of digital healthcare to be able to work in this domain. However, I see a lot of benefits of having a CWC on your digital healthcare team:\n\nA broad understanding of the intricacies of how computers work and how they can complement, rather than hinder, clinicians and their workflows.\nServe as a translator between digital and clinical teams.\nWhy not have the end-user on your team to tell you what is and what is not going to work!"
