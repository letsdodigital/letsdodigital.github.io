## Executive Summary

The project aims to develop a free to use, online guide titled **Essentials of Health Informatics**. This guide will serve as a comprehensive resource in health informatics. The target audience will include healthcare professionals, those in digital roles and students interested in health informatics. The initial business plan includes the delivery of ten pay-to-watch 1-hour webinars covering topics identified through survey. Additionally, the project will seek external sponsorship to support its financial sustainability. Subject matter experts will prepare their presentations, present at the webinar, and contribute to the guide. This project will utilise an **Education as a Service** model, providing flexible, up-to-date and accessible learning opportunities in contrast to traditional university degrees and hard copy textbooks.

The benefits of this project include providing widespread access to up-to-date information in health informatics, funded through webinar fees, paid-for-viewing of webinar recordings and sponsorship. The guide will be regularly reviewed and updated, ensuring its relevance and accuracy compared to static hard copy guides. If the first 10 webinars are successful, additional series of webinars on different topics will be delivered.

## Introduction


### Background

**Bailey Medics Ltd**, under the trade name **Let's Do Digital**, aims to bridge the knowledge gap in health informatics by creating an accessible, continuously updated online guide. The healthcare sector's increasing reliance on informatics necessitates a reliable and current resource for professionals and enthusiasts alike. By adopting an **Education as a Service** approach, Bailey Medics Ltd aims to offer flexible, up-to-date and accessible learning opportunities that keep pace with advancements in health informatics.


### Objectives

* To create and maintain a **comprehensive** and **free to access** online guide on health informatics.
* To conduct a series of webinars as a revenue stream and educational initiative.
* To engage with 2-5 external sponsors as an additional revenue stream.
* To ensure the guide remains current through regular reviews and updates.
* To expand the webinar series if the initial 10 webinars are successful.
* To later develop a paid for exam covering the topic of health informatics.

### Scope

The project encompasses the development of the guide, organisation and delivery of webinars, securing sponsorship, and engaging subject matter experts for content creation and examination questions.

### Feedback

Feedback from social engagements has been very positive. A post by Mark Bailey (of Bailey Medics Ltd) on LinkedIn about the guide (initially referred to as the “Handbook of Clinical Informatics”) had many positive comments and large numbers of engagements. As of the 30th of July, this post regarding the guide had **4771 impressions**, **2520 unique views**, and **36 comments**. The top reaction was from **Clinical Scientists** and the top comments were from **Medical Doctors**. The post can be viewed [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markbaileyci_i-am-curious-about-something-and-would-greatly-activity-7204555745709731841-gO_0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).


## Problem Statement


### Problem Definition

There is a lack of accessible, up-to-date resources in health informatics, which hinders learning and professional development in this rapidly evolving field. Traditional hard copy guides are quickly outdated and less accessible, failing to meet the ongoing needs of learners.

### Impact

Without a reliable and current resource, healthcare professionals may struggle to stay informed about the latest advancements and best practices in health informatics. Benefits of actively engaging and learning from these educational materials include improved job performance and advancement opportunities. Our **Education as a Service** model addresses this gap by providing continuous, accessible learning opportunities, unlike static university degrees and textbooks.


## Target Audience

The guide, webinars and exam will be aimed at healthcare professionals, those in digital roles and students interested in health informatics.


## Analysis of Options


### Option 1: Traditional Printed Guide

* **Pros:** Tangible, one-time cost for production.
* **Cons:** Quickly outdated, high distribution costs, limited accessibility.


### Option 2: Static Online Guide

* **Pros:** Wider accessibility, lower distribution costs.
* **Cons:** Still requires regular updates, initial development cost.


### Option 3: Traditional University Delivery

* **Pros:** Established educational framework, recognised credentials.
* **Cons:** High costs for students, inflexible schedules, slow curriculum updates, limited accessibility for non-traditional students.


### Option 4: Interactive Online Guide with Webinars (Proposed Solution)

* **Pros:** Continuously updated, wide accessibility, interactive learning through webinars, potential for revenue through fees and sponsorship. This **Education as a Service** model offers flexible, ongoing educational opportunities.
* **Cons:** Requires ongoing maintenance, initial setup costs, risk of low uptake.


## Proposed Solution


### Solution

Develop an interactive online guide on health informatics, supported by an initial series of ten 1-hour webinars.
