# How Has Healthcare Changed With Technology? {background-image="/media/new-butterfly.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

---

## The Old Way

- Doctors wrote notes on paper.
- Results and correspondence were sent by post.
- If you needed medical advice, you had to visit a clinic in person.
- There were no mobile apps or online health services.

---

## Paper Records in 2001

<div class="fact-pop">Only 18% of U.S. doctors used electronic records in 2001</div>

## Early Digital Changes (1980s - 2000s)

- Most early digital health developments in the UK started in GP practices.
- GP systems were some of the first to adopt electronic records, replacing paper files.
- Early prescription systems allowed doctors to send prescriptions to pharmacies digitally.
- Hospitals started using computers for administrative tasks, but most patient records were still on paper.
- Early telemedicine experiments allowed doctors to give advice over the phone.

---

## The Digital Health Boom (2010s - Now)

- **Smartphones & Apps:** Patients started using apps for tracking health, fitness, and medications.
- **Electronic Health Records (EHRs):** Hospitals and clinics moved to digital records and functionality.
- **Telemedicine Growth:** Video calls with doctors became more common, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.

---

## The Digital Health Boom (2010s - Now)

- **Wearable Devices:** Smartwatches and fitness trackers allowed people to monitor their health in real-time.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI is showing promise to help doctors analyse scans and predict illnesses more accurately.
- **Big Data in Healthcare:** Large amounts of health data has helped scientists understand disease better.

---

## Wearables in Action

<div class="fact-pop">In 2024, 30 million U.S. patients used remote monitoring tools like smartwatches</div>

<footer>PatentPC,"Remote Patient Monitoring: Growth & Adoption Stats", 2025, <https://patentpc.com/blog/remote-patient-monitoring-growth-adoption-stats></footer>

---

## The Potential Future of Digital Health

- More personalised care using AI and health data.
- Faster diagnosis and treatment through automation.
- More remote monitoring and home-based healthcare.
- Better integration between digital systems to make healthcare more efficient.

# What Are the Main Digital Tools in Healthcare?{background-image="/media/tools.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

---

## 1. Electronic Patient Records (EPRs)

- Also called Electronic Health Records (EHRs).
- A computer version of a patient’s medical history.
- Tries to condense all the required data and functionality into one system.

---

## EPRs Worldwide

<div class="fact-pop">In 2019, 100% of UK GP practices used EPRs, compared to 71% in Switzerland</div>

---

## 2. Telemedicine

- Talking to a doctor using a video call instead of going to a clinic.
- Useful for people who live far away or cannot travel easily.

---

## 3. Health Apps

- Apps that help track steps, diet, sleep, or medical conditions.
- Examples: A diabetes app that reminds people to check their blood sugar.

---

## Health App Boom

<div class="fact-pop">Health app downloads surged 50% globally during the COVID-19 pandemic</div>

<footer>World Economy Forum, "Fitness apps grew by nearly 50% during the first half of 2020, study finds", 2020, <https://www.weforum.org/stories/2020/09/fitness-apps-gym-health-downloads/></footer>

---

## 4. Wearable Devices

- Smartwatches and fitness trackers that measure heart rate, sleep, and activity.
- Some devices can alert doctors if something is wrong.

---

## 5. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare

- AI can help doctors read X-rays or predict health problems.
- Some chatbots give basic health advice based on symptoms.
- But: Not yet accurate or safe enough for routine use—lots of hype still unproven.
